The city was still sleeping. He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass. 
Then he sat in the sun-filled doorway, smoking the hookah. 

He smoked in silence, thinking of nothing, and listening to the sound of the wind that brought the scent of 
the desert. When he had finished his smoke, he reached into one of his pockets, and sat there for a few 
moments, regarding what he had withdrawn. 

It was a bundle of money. Enough to buy himself a hundred and twenty sheep, a return ticket, and a 
license to import products from Africa into his own country. 

He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop. Then the two went off to have some 
more tea. 

"I'm leaving today," said the boy. "I have the money I need to buy my sheep. And you have the money 
you need to go to Mecca." 

The old man said nothing. 

"Will you give me your blessing?" asked the boy. "You have helped me." The man continued to prepare 
his tea, saying nothing. Then he turned to the boy. 

"I am proud of you," he said. "You brought a new feeling into my crystal shop. But you know that I'm 
not going to go to Mecca. Just as you know that you're not going to buy your sheep." 

"Who told you that?" asked the boy, startled. 

"Maktub " said the old crystal merchant. 

And he gave the boy his blessing. 



The boy went to his room and packed his belongings. They filled three sacks. As he was leaving, he 
saw, in the comer of the room, his old shepherd's pouch. It was bunched up, and he had hardly thought 
of it for a long time. As he took his j acket out of the pouch, thinking to give it to someone in the street, 
the two stones fell to the floor. Urim and Thummim. 

It made the boy think of the old king, and it startled him to realize how long it had been since he had 
thought of him. For nearly a year, he had been working incessantly, thinking only of putting aside enough 
money so that he could return to Spain with pride. 

"Never stop dreaming," the old king had said. "Follow the omens." 

The boy picked up Urim and Thummim, and, once again, had the strange sensation that the old king was 
nearby. He had worked hard for a year, and the omens were that it was time to go. 

I'm going to go back to doing just what I did before, the boy thought. Even though the sheep didn't teach 
me to speak Arabic. 



But the sheep had taught him something even more important: that there was a language in the world that 
everyone understood, a language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying to improve 
things at the shop. It was the language of enthusiasm, of things accomplished with love and purpose, and 
as part of a search for something believed in and desired. Tangier was no longer a strange city, and he 
felt that, just as he had conquered this place, he could conquer the world. 

"When you want something, all the universe conspires to help you achieve it," the old king had said. 

But the old king hadn't said anything about being robbed, or about endless deserts, or about people who 
know what their dreams are but don't want to realize them. The old king hadn't told him that the 
Pyramids were just a pile of stones, or that anyone could build one in his backyard. And he had forgotten 
to mention that, when you have enough money to buy a flock larger than the one you had before, you 
should buy it. 

The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things. He went down the stairs and found the 
merchant waiting on a foreign couple, while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea 
from crystal glasses. It was more activity than usual for this time of the morning. From where he stood, he 
saw for the first time that the old merchant's hair was very much like the hair of the old king. He 
remembered the smile of the candy seller, on his first day in Tangier, when he had nothing to eat and 
nowhere to go — that smile had also been like the old king's smile. 

It's almost as if he had been here and left his mark, he thought. And yet, none of these people has ever 
met the old king. On the other hand, he said that he always appeared to help those who are trying to 
realize their destiny. 

He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant. He didn't want to cry with the other people 
there. He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned. He was more confident in 
himself, though, and felt as though he could conquer the world. 

"But I'm going back to the fields that I know, to take care of my flock again." He said that to himself with 
certainty, but he was no longer happy with his decision. He had worked for an entire year to make a 
dream come true, and that dream, minute by minute, was becoming less important. Maybe because that 
wasn't really his dream. 

Who knows. . . maybe it's better to be like the crystal merchant: never go to Mecca, and just go through 
life wanting to do so, he thought, again trying to convince himself. But as he held Urim and Thurnmim in 
his hand, they had transmitted to him the strength and will of the old king. By coincidence — or maybe it 
was an omen, the boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day there. The thief wasn't 
there, and the owner brought him a cup of tea. 

I can always go back to being a shepherd, the boy thought. I learned how to care for sheep, and I 
haven't forgotten how that's done. But maybe I'll never have another chance to get to the Pyramids in 
Egypt. The old man wore a breastplate of gold, and he knew about my past. He really was a king, a wise 
king. 

The hills of Andalusia were only two hours away, but there was an entire desert between him and the 
Pyramids. Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation: he was actually two hours 
closer to his treasure. . . the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter. 

I know why I want to get back to my flock, he thought. I understand sheep; they're no longer a problem, 
and they can be good friends. On the other hand, I don't know if the desert can be a friend, and it's in the 



desert that I have to search for my treasure. If I don't find it, I can always go home. I finally have enough 
money, and all the time I need. Why not? 

He suddenly felt tremendously happy. He could always go back to being a shepherd. He could always 
become a crystal salesman again. Maybe the world had other hidden treasures, but he had a dream, and 
he had met with a king. That doesn't happen to just anyone! 

He was planning as he left the bar. He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant's suppliers 
transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert. He held Urim and Thummim in his 
hand; because of those two stones, he was once again on the way to his treasure. 

"I am always nearby, when someone wants to realize their destiny," the old king had told him. 

What could it cost to go over to the supplier's warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far 
away? 
The Englishman was sitting on a bench in a structure that smelled of animals, sweat, and dust; it was part 
warehouse, part corral. I never thought I'd end up in a place like this, he thought, as he leafed through the 
pages of a chemical journal. Ten years at the university, and here I am in a corral. 

But he had to move on. He believed in omens. All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the 
one true language of the universe. First he had studied Esperanto, then the world's religions, and now it 
was alchemy. He knew how to speak Esperanto, he understood all the major religions well, but he wasn't 
yet an alchemist. He had unraveled the truths behind important questions, but his studies had taken him to 
a point beyond which he could not seem to go. He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an 
alchemist. But the alchemists were strange people, who thought only about themselves, and almost 
always refused to help him. Who knows, maybe they had failed to discover the secret of the Master 
Work — the Philosopher's Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves. 

He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his father, fruitlessly seeking the Philosopher's 
Stone. He had spent enormous amounts of time at the great libraries of the world, and had purchased all 
the rarest and most important volumes on alchemy. In one he had read that, many years ago, a famous 
Arabian alchemist had visited Europe. It was said that he was more than two hundred years old, and that 
he had discovered the Philosopher's Stone and the Elixir of Life. The Englishman had been profoundly 
impressed by the story. But he would never have thought it more than just a myth, had not a friend of 
his — retorting from an archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was 
possessed of exceptional powers. 

"He lives at the Al-Fayoum oasis," his friend had said. "And people say that he is two hundred years old, 
and is able to transform any metal into gold." 

The Englishman could not contain his excitement. He canceled all his commitments and pulled together 
the most important of his books, and now here he was, sitting inside a dusty, smelly warehouse. Outside, 
a huge caravan was being prepared for a crossing of the Sahara, and was scheduled to pass through 
Al-Fayoum. 

I'm going to find that damned alchemist, the Englishman thought. And the odor of the animals became a 
bit more tolerable. 



A young Arab, also loaded down with baggage, entered, and greeted the Englishman. 

"Where are you bound?" asked the young Arab. 

"I'm going into the desert," the man answered, turning back to his reading. He didn't want any 
conversation at this point. What he needed to do was review all he had learned over the years, because 
the alchemist would certainly put him to the test. 

The young Arab took out a book and began to read. The book was written in Spanish. That's good, 
thought the Englishman. He spoke Spanish better than Arabic, and, if this boy was going to Al-Fayoum, 
there would be someone to talk to when there were no other important things to do. 



"That's strange," said the boy, as he tried once again to read the burial scene that began the book. "I've 
been trying for two years to read this book, and I never get past these first few pages." Even without a 
king to provide an interruption, he was unable to concentrate. 

He still had some doubts about the decision he had made. But he was able to understand one thing: 
making a decision was only the beginning of things. When someone makes a decision, he is really diving 
into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the 
decision. 

When I decided to seek out my treasure, I never imagined that I'd wind up working in a crystal shop, he 
thought. And joining this caravan may have been my decision, but where it goes is going to be a mystery 
tome. 

Nearby was the Englishman, reading a book. He seemed unfriendly, and had looked irritated when the 
boy had entered. They might even have become friends, but the Englishman closed off the conversation. 

The boy closed his book. He felt that he didn't want to do anything that might make him look like the 
Englishman. He took Urim and Thummim from his pocket, and began playing with them. 

The stranger shouted, "Urim and Thummim!" 

In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket. 

"They're not for sale," he said. 

"They're not worth much," the Englishman answered. "They're only made of rock crystal, and there are 
millions of rock crystals in the earth. But those who know about such things would know that those are 
Urim and Thummim. I didn't know that they had them in this part of the world." 

"They were given to me as a present by a king," the boy said. 

The stranger didn't answer; instead, he put his hand in his pocket, and took out two stones that were the 
same as the boy's. 

"Did you say a king?" he asked. 

"I guess you don't believe that a king would talk to someone like me, a shepherd," he said, wanting to 



end the conversation. 

"Not at all. It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a king that the rest of the world refused to 
acknowledge. So, it's not surprising that kings would talk to shepherds." 

And he went on, fearing that the boy wouldn't understand what he was talking about, "It's in the Bible. 
The same book that taught me about Urim and Thummim. These stones were the only form of divination 
permitted by God. The priests carried them in a golden breastplate." 

The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse. 

"Maybe this is an omen," said the Englishman, half aloud. 

"Who told you about omens?" The boy's interest was increasing by the moment. 

"Everything in life is an omen," said the Englishman, now closing the journal he was reading. "There is a 
universal language, understood by everybody, but already forgotten. I am in search of that universal 
language, among other things. That's why I'm here. I have to find a man who knows that universal 
language. An alchemist." 

The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss. 

"You're in luck, you two," the fat Arab said. "There's a caravan leaving today for Al-Fayoum." 

"But I'm going to Egypt," the boy said. 

"Al-Fayoum is in Egypt," said the Arab. "What kind of Arab are you?" 

"That's a good luck omen," the Englishman said, after the fat Arab had gone out. "If I could, I'd write a 
huge encyclopedia just about the wordsluck anticoincidence. It's with those words that the universal 
language is written." 

He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with Urim and Thummim in his hand. And he 
asked the boy if he, too, were in search of the alchemist. 

"I'm looking for a treasure," said the boy, and he immediately regretted having said it. But the Englishman 
appeared not to attach any importance to it. 

"In a way, so am I," he said. 

"I don't even know what alchemy is," the boy was saying, when the warehouse boss called to them to 
come outside.
