Long-inactive lungs stir to life. Blood rushes through still veins. Blinding light sears eyes that have been closed for millennia.

God, what did I drink last night? My head's pounding. I turn over and vomit into a conveniently placed bucket. I can't remember the last time I got blackout drunk. I can't remember the last time I... did anything, actually.

Voices filter in from outside the room, in some foreign language, and that's when I notice where I am. Fine, synthetic sheets. Cold metal furniture. Light strips built into the walls and ceilings. This has to be some kind of space station.

…I’m not sure why that was my first thought. I could be anywhere. There’s a glowing display on the wall, though, with gravity, population, and atmosphere data. A scrolling channel proudly displays ‘WELCOME TO SALVUS STATION’, alongside a graphic of stars. Looks like my first guess was right.

The ‘bucket’ whirrs, chimes ‘WASTE DISPOSAL OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL ACTIVATED’, and my mess is automatically cleaned up. That seems strange to me, but I can’t quite put my finger on why. The door opens, and this is when I realize the voices aren't speaking in a foreign language at all. It's English - just sort of.. mangled. It’s understandable, though.

"You're up." My host grunts at me, and I miss the first few words, because I’m just now realizing he’s got four fucking arms. And blue skin. "Get up. Your friend didn't pay for two nights, and you've got to be out in an hour."

It takes a few seconds before I can speak. "…Where am I?" 

"First stasis-sickness? I should've guessed. You must be new." His expression softens, and he waves me over. "Come downstairs, I'll buy you a pint."

The room downstairs is filled with humanoids of all kinds. One-eyed creatures, five-eyed creatures, from four to ten feet tall. In all the colors of the rainbow. None of that’s as strange as the fact that they’re all speaking English, or at least some variant of it.

The ‘pint’ turns out to be a bowl of stew and a mug of something golden and vaguely fruity. I’m told it’s a stasis-sickness brew. I hurl twice before getting the stew down. The drink goes down like silk. 

"Nine, son, I've never seen someone with the sickness as bad as you. You've got a weak stomach." He slaps my shoulder with the sort of good-natured smile that suggests he'd been the same way. I decide to chance a few questions. I don’t think I’ve been kidnapped, and Four-arms is accommodating enough. 

"So... How'd I get here? What's stasis-sickness?" 

My host frowns. "You really don't remember? Well, here's the short version. Void Hoppers - that's you, transport goods across the Void. Makes faster-than-light travel possible. Only thing is, living creatures can't survive the journey. Not even Augments. The dimension is... tainted, somehow. Spend too long in it, basking in its radiation, and you die. You wither away, the flesh comes off your bones, nasty shit. So we go into stasis to make the journey. Takes a few weeks with a standard ship. No food, no water, no air needed. Nice and easy."

"How can we communicate with each other?" 

None of this is familiar. It can’t be. And yet, something squirms at the back of my mind. I know this place. Or at least this information.

"The Nine and their race, the Old Ones, gave all races the gift of the Common tongue. And of Void engine technology. They’re gone now, but -" His frown deepens. "You really don't remember anything? Temporary memory loss is common, but I never forgot what I was doing completely. Every kid’s taught Common in school. You know your own name, at least?"

It takes a moment before I can. "James."

"James. That's an Old name, eh? Bet your parents knew you'd be a Void Hopper. I'm Lamora."

 

 

My 'friend' arrives that afternoon. He drops a few credits into Lamora's wallet, waves me over, and we set off. Lamora gives me a cheery wave and the customary farewell from one Hopper to another. "Laugh into the Void," he says.

"...Till the Void laughs back," mutters my hooded companion. 

The station outside is fascinating. It’s got some sort of transparent field looking out over space, and miles and miles of gleaming metal and ceramic houses. Glowing signs in the distance advertise augments, upgrades, holofilms and the latest synthetic drugs. All in English. My head spins, and it’s not just from the stasis.

Asking questions has worked out pretty well so far. My companion’s been quiet, so I break the silence. 

"So, where am I? How'd I get here? Why'd you pay for my stay?”

My companion turns, flips their hood back, and I can get a good look at him - or her, I now see - for the first time. She's got angular features and dark hair. She’d look almost human, if it weren’t for the extra finger on each hand and the red skin. "No questions. Not till I've asked mine."

"Okay, well-"

"Who are you?"

"James."

"Not your name, who are you?"

"I don't understand."

"A few days ago, my stasis failed while my ship was mid-Hop. There are backup pods for these things, of course - it wasn't a big deal. But I found something drifting through Voidspace while my ship was stopped for repairs. And I broke the first Law getting it here.”

The First Law, as I'd learned from Lamora, was simply 'Never take anything from the Void.' The objects within were tainted, and would kill just as surely as the Void itself. Many tales had been told of greedy Hoppers who saw the chance to grab some Old artifacts – and paid the price. I leaned in and lowered my voice. "…From inside the Void? That's stupid. How would you even- no, why would you-" 

"I've been laughing into the Void for a long time, James." She pauses. "Guess it was about time it laughed back. That thing was you. And I've got a feeling you've been out there a lot longer than a few weeks.”

We talk over lunch. It’s savory broth, chunks of meat, rice noodles, and fresh herbs. It seems familiar. In any case, the light dish is a common post-stasis meal. The venue’s a little hole-in-the-wall place, and it’s packed from glass wall to wall with recovering Hoppers. A three-eyed green fellow turns his head and hurls into a specially placed bucket by his seat. His crewmates just keep eating. Guess they’ve got strong stomachs.

Aliens aside, it’s a very familiar-feeling place, and I can almost forget I’m probably thousands of light-years from home. Then again, I don’t have any more than a vague idea of where -or what - home is. 

“…’re Sarcorians. So. I figured I’d dump you with Lamora for the night, pick you up after.”

It takes a moment for me to realize what my companion, who’s identified herself as ‘Rsu’, is saying. “You were going to let Lamora die of Void radiation poisoning to keep yourself safe?”

“Only if all the scans were wrong!” She protests. “I put you through the decontamination sweep like the rest of the crew. And I swept you four times with the Void scanner. You were clean. Somehow. Guess your stasis pod had some autorepair functions – pricey bit of gear, I’m thinking. Where’d you get it? I don’t recognize the model.” She doesn’t give me an opportunity to reply. “Anyway, it all worked out.”

“But what if-“

“Hey, I paid him, didn’t I? Sure, I might not have told him you were from the Void – you might want to keep your mouth shut about that, by the way –“

I look around the nearby tables. Nobody’s sober enough to be listening in.

“-But you’re fine! If you were going to die, or poison anyone else, you’d have done it already. You should be thanking me, honestly. Otherwise, you’d still be out there.”

It’s hard to argue with that one. I bury my head in my noodles.

“So what species are you?” 

“Human,” I mumble through a mouthful of broth. I’m starving. I gesture towards Rsu’s half-finished bowl – she just pushes it over. I dig in.

“Never heard of ‘em.” She crosses her arms, sets her elbows on the table and leans in. “Young race? New to the cosmos?”

“I don’t know. I can’t really remember.”

Rsu gives me an appraising look, then sits back. “Anyway, welcome to the Rim. It’s a real wildland out here – ‘bout as far from the galactic center as you can get. None of the Old Lanes come here, so the only people you’ll find are Hoppers. Think your home planet’s around here? It’d make sense.”

“…Maybe.” I’m doubtful.

“Well, I’ll help you find it. Getting home would be nice, right?

“Right.” But I know there’s going to be a price.

“I just need one thing first,” she says, right on cue.

And then the window explodes. I don’t even get to finish my broth.

“Get down!” Someone shouts.

Whoever’s just started shooting clearly doesn’t know how things work around here, because even I know not to start a fight. Millions of blasters seem to appear as all the patrons of the little noodle shop get up and return fire. A station populated entirely by heavily-armed Hoppers? It occurs to me that the bank robberies here must be fucking wild. 

We don’t partake in the firefight, though. Rsu pushes my head down and weaves me between tables, going for the back exit. Blasterfire, lasers, and magnetic projectiles fly over our heads. A few Hoppers fall, steaming from various superheated entry wounds, but there’s no time to stop and help. I catch sight of a few of the assailants – Humanoids in black body armor, with cables coming out of the fronts of their helmets – before Rsu pushes me past a toppled table.

We make it to an alley. And, of course, there are two more of them outside.

“Tongues,” Rsu curses.

One breaks out a stun baton – the other drops his rifle to follow suit. They want us alive? Interesting. Rsu doesn’t seem to feel the same way. She pulls a blaster and shoots both of them in the chest. “Come on,” she says, stepping over their bodies. Then one of them reaches out and grabs her leg. I knew that’d be too easy.

I can’t remember ever being in a fight, and I certainly haven’t ever faced down a pair of terrifying, identical killing machines in black blasterproof armor. But as one of them slams Rsu face-first into the ground, and the other rises to look at me, I realize diplomacy probably won’t cut it.

The first figure swings his stun baton at me, and suddenly, everything feels familiar. This situation – I’ve never experienced it before, but suddenly, I have. 

Two assailants, one distracted, one with a melee weapon. Swinging from the right hand. Humanoid combatants, two arms, two legs. Body armor present. Helmets on both, discarded projectile weapon two meters away on the ground.

My body blurs into motion before I realize what’s happening. Dodge. Dodge. I spin low and let a blow pass overhead, then reach up and grab the assailant’s hand. A rapid disarm follows – one that’s too fast for me to process, even though I’m the one executing it. My assailant steps back in shock, reaching for his blaster – but thinks better of it. They still need us.

His partner’s realized there’s something wrong by now, of course. He lets go of Rsu, draws his own baton, and tosses a second one to his disarmed partner.

This is more like it.

Dodge. Dodge. Block. Parry. Riposte. I pull some sort of ridiculous spin-maneuver that blocks two swings at once – it’d never have worked in real time. But everything’s in slow motion right now, and work it does. Rsu’s eyes are wide. 

Block. Block. Leap. Whatever training, or program, or fucking divine intervention is running my body right now, it’s not just beating these two attackers. It’s making a show of it.

Not a single blow has landed on me. My stun-baton hits armor over and over again, discharging its battery, but not much makes it through the plating. 

Everything’s still slowed down. I knock one back, and grab a handful of the other’s helmet cords before pulling him down into my upward knee.  Whatever space-ceramic his faceplate’s made of – it shatters. He goes down. I punch his partner’s faceplate, and instead of pulverizing my bones – it shatters, too.

God. Damn. 

Or is it, as they say, Nine?
