I’ve Become A Dog
Wa~, I’m hungry~

My stomach’s been empty since forever. I’m dead. I might as well die.

When it made a pitiful sound like *miiyuu*, I heard a sound that seems to be in a hurry, and I was grabbed.

“Sorry, sorry. I forgot about you.”

I was lying on my back on top of a man’s arm and something was violently shoved in my mouth.

Oi, what are you doing.(?)

While I was wildly waving my legs with *batabata*, I tasted something sweet in my mouth. Oh, it’s milk. So good. It’s so delicious!

While I was drinking with *gubigubi* like crazy, something within my mouth was suddenly pulled out.

Unu. I wanted to drink some more.

“Okay, that’s enough. If you keep drinking like, your stomach’s gonna burst.”

I was once again rolled into something warm and soft.

From the surroundings, you can hear either tiny *myuu* or *kyuu* sounds. I can feel something warm moving but somehow, I couldn’t open my eyes and I could see nothing.

A fart and a burp came out. Ah, this time, my stomach is full.

In the meantime, since I can’t move, I decided to sleep. While I was moving around within the wrapped cloth, I’m being encased by something warm.

Somehow, I don’t know why but from time to time, I’m being kicked by something and it hurts. But my stomach has become full so I’m satisfied.

So sleepy.

After waking up from a deep sleep, I got hungry again.

I’m hungry~.

For the time being, when I tried crying *kyuukyuu*, a man came from somewhere and gave me milk. As usual, something’s violently shoved in my mouth so I gagged for a bit but the milk is delicious. *Gungun* I drank desperately. When I finished drinking, I became sleepy. As I yawned widely, I once again got covered by something I don’t know. I slept while under something.

And then, I got hungry when I woke up again so I cried *kyuukyuu*, got some milk which I drank, took a sh*t, and went back to sleep.

The cycle repeats.

Sleep, take a sh*t, sleep. Those were my daily routines

“Kyuu~(I’m hungry).”

“A~ yes, yes. It seems your voice has grown louder, huh.”

A man who looked like he’s in a hurry came and lifted me up.

“He~re, drink. Drink a lot.”

Something’s being thrusted in my mouth. It’s milk, isn’t it. Umu, today’s delicious as well.

After I finished drinking and burped, I felt like I could open my eyes a little.

Ah, maybe I can see something?

It’s a man. There’s a man. He looks pretty young. His long brown hair is tied behind his head in a ponytail.(I just assume it’s a ponytail) He has a long nose. So it’s this guy who gives me milk every time. U~n, he seems to be the air-headed type, huh.

But this guy, he’s somewhat huge.

“Oh, Chibi (temporary name of MC), can you open your eyes already?”

The man approached with his face. Uu, his face is too big. It’s scary. When I tried to push his face away, the man carried me over like I’m weightless. (TN: My assumption since I don’t get it.)

“N, you seem to have gained some weight. Yosh, you’re doing well, very well.”

The man returned me to the blanket and went somewhere.

I, who was left behind, had a thought.

I stared at my own body.

I drink milk and have a round stomach. Tiny little feet, my stomach is white, my feet are covered with something light brown and fluffy. I twisted my body to take a look at my back. As I thought, it’s covered with hair all over.

… Are~e? (TN: huh?)

When I looked at my palms hesitantly, there are tiny paws attached.

What the heck is this?

I recognize what’s before me. But I don’t understand what’s happened. Rather, I don’t want to understand.

Aren’t I supposed to be human? What’s with this body?

The closest one resembling this appearance that I recognized was a dog. It’s a puppy.

… A dog?

Me, a dog? I’m a dog? the dog is me? Eh, wai, hold on a second, since when has it turned out like this?

Eh? Eh? I was supposed to be a human, right? Wasn’t I just a normal high school student? Why? Why am I a dog?

Eh, could it be that I’m dead?

Inside my head, I could hear the sound of a bell from a temple.

You serious? I don’t remember at all but I’m dead for sure, huh. I died and reincarnated as a dog.

Ehh, for me to be a dog, what did I do? I have absolutely no idea.

Still, why haven’t I noticed it until now?

I’m a dog.
Maa~ that’s what I’ve become so I can’t help it.

I had no idea when I’d fallen asleep but I felt strangely refreshed when I woke up.
When I noticed that I’ve turned into a dog, I thought I’d be troubled for a while, but surprisingly, I’m not depressed or even troubled by it.
Is it because my brain is that of a dog’s?

As I was about to open my mouth to yawn, my puppy sibling came over and licked my mouth.
Ou, good morning.
As I placed my front legs on its shoulders and mimick the dog’s way of biting its neck, brother doggy’s eyes twinkled as he pounced at me. *Kapukapu* My feet are being bitten. What’s this bastard doing? I got carried away and a fight started before long. We both bit each other’s ears and tail using our newly-sprouted canine teeth. When I mistook my strength control, I’d get railed at. After that, we played tag, running around the room with all our might.

The interior or the room was very small and simple. It’s wall made of wood was full of scratches. Above a small shelf, a piece of cloth was left. I that thing stuck into the wall a lamp? There are also various things loitered around. From the big window came in plenty of sunlight.
After we played a lot, we bundled up together, kicking and being kicked as we go to sleep.
Un. A dog’s life sure is fun.

As time passed by quickly, I’ve grown a bit bigger.
My stomach is still round as usual and my limbs are still short but my legs have grown a bit longer, enabling me to move around easier
My doggie siblings are also gradually getting bigger. I am still acting puppy-like as puppies are, but my eyes are properly opened and my ears are standing alertly. It’s just that the length of my legs differs from my siblings which wprroes me. Everyone else has shiny reddish brown fur on their bodies with big black ears. Their pupils are gold. It’s very shiny, it looks beautiful and cool.

The brown-haired man comes daily and puts us in a scale to check our weights.
[Checking for eye problems, all good. The mouth, good. The butt, okay.]
Everyday, my eyes are checked, my mouth is being surveyed and my butthole is being stared at.
It’s humiliating. However, as I experience these things everyday, I somehow got used to it. He’s taking care of our poop, as well.
This guy is probably a breeder, is what I thought. From morning till late at night, he takes care of us . However, I don’t see any other personel or other dogs aside from my siblings.

[It’s almost time now…]

As he was checking our conditions, the brown-haireed man muttered.
As I thought, “N?”, the man looked up.
[The delivery time is… three days, huh.]
As the man briskly looked at the note posted on the wall, his voice leaked out.

Could it be…

The foreboding that passed through my head came true three days later.
Apparently, we’re being shipped.
The prevvious day, when the brown-haired man was enthusiastically observing us, he seemed pleased with our growth and gave a nod before placing us in a box and then carried us into a tub of lukewarm water. (?)
Since it’s the first time my siblings have seen such a huge amount of water, they were curiously looking all over. But when the man started to pour water on us one by one to wash, they didn’t like it and started crying “myumyu”.
After the man finished wasging us one by one, he wiped us with a towel to dry. My sibling also started licking their own bodies actively.

Yoshi, it’s finally my turn now.

I walked until the edge of the tub and sat before the brown-haired man and looked up to him.
My wait is done. Please do it at once.
The man laughed a little and lifted me up.

[What is it? Do you want to be washed?]

The man somehow placed me on the top of his knees and earnestly scratched my head.
Yes, I, for once, am a former Japanese person so I like taking baths.
I stuck out my chest and wagged my tail.

[Is that so? Alright, then.]
The man placed my in the tub with a splash. The water was no longer different from a cold water but in a dog’s perspective, it’s not a problem.
It felt good to have my body washed. The man gently rubbed my body. I’ve become attached to his soothing touch.
[That’s right, should I take you with me for once?]
The man murmured quietly.

N? Was he planning on leaving me behind?

[Well, it’s fine even if we can’t find your owner. I’m planning on keeping you as you are.]
The man said so as he earnestly scratched my head again.

…Uhmm, wasn’t I supposed to be for sale?
I thought for a little bit, then I gaped.
No, from the very beginning, I thought that my fur color isn’t pretty, my ears seem small and my legs are shorter compared to my other siblings.
Is that why? Am I that ugly?
Seriously?

I had a hard time translating the scenery discriptions. Just imaagine the old Europian era in general. 

Wow, what’s in here?

We got the carriage and passed by a lively town.
That’s right, it’s a carriage.
It’s shaking so bad it”s hard to relax.
When I look at the brown-haired guy’s clothes and room, it has a retro feeling to it.
So this place isn’t Japan. It’s not even an era I know of. It’s an unknown world.
Road laid with cobblestone, walls painted with white and dull red with yellow plasters, doors and windows made of wood that emanates the feeling of withstanding throught time, reddish brown tile roofs. [TN:I’ve no idea about this.]
I can see the faces of the passers by look like those of Europians. The women have wore white blouse with fluffy sleeves and wide opening on their chests paired with long skirt that reaches the ankles. There’re people wearing aprons and also people who seems to be wearing vests. The men are wearing light brown shirts, black pants and leather shoes. People who are wearing vests with strange appearances and long jackets, and also short-length pants and white tights can also be seen. There’re also people withh swords hanging from their waists which surprised me. [TN:I’m very confused. In other words, your usual ancient European style, I guess. ]
Yep. This is definitely not Japan.
Now that I think about it, therer might not be any electricity in the room were at before. I was always asleep at night so I’m not really sure.

On a building which looks like a shop, the entrance was decorated with black mettal-like thing but I didn’t understand what the writings on it meant. In the meantime, I understood that those weren’t Japanese nor English. (the language)
By the way, I seemed to understand what the man has been saying, but come to think of it, it didn’t seem to be Japanese. I wonder why I can understand it. How strange.

Within the town is full of smell and sound.
The lively voices of the vendors, the children’s laughter, and also other various noises. There are boxes that seems to be overflowing with fruits of different colors and wierd appearances. There’re also vegetables, sausages and meat.
Incomparable to when I was human, my nose could pick up a lot of attractive smell. The smell of water, the smell of earth, the smell of oil, the smell of humans, and a smell that I don’t understand. It’s very amazing, very interesting.
With our curious selves onboard, the carriage advances while shaking and making a rattling sound.

The place we arrived at was at a big street, in front of a small shop.
From inside, I could here the lively sound of animals.
The brown-haired guy set the cage we’re in down the carriage and brought us inside the store.

[Yo, Yorugen . Here are the Henexian children I promised you.] (TN: so I just made it as is.)
For some reason, we were placed on top of a counter.
[Yeah.]
Behind the counter was a plump and fat old man. The old man picked my siblings up one by one and started inspecting them here and there.
[Fu~n, as always, your place always obtains amazing goods.]
[Thanks]
From the counter, the old man opened up a drawer and took out a bundle of paper bills and handed it to the brown-haired man. The man carefully counter the money before putting it in his pocket.

Hmm, is the old man called Yorugen the shope owner? Also, we’re being sold to this old man.
This is probably a petshop.
I stretched my neck and sniffed the surrounding.
Uwaa, there are a lot of different beastly smells.
Looking around the inside of the shop, I saw cages stacked firmly in the dimly narrow store, and there were many animals in it.There’s a big-eyed monkey like beast, a multi-colored bird, there’s also a big-eared, long-tailed animal. There’s also a small leopard look-alike. But somehow, different from the animals I’m familiar with, they all look new to me.
While I was busily looking all over the shop, the old man grabeed me by the neck.
He looked at me intently.

[So, what’s this thing that’s mixed in here?]

Eh? Was he talking about me?

[Cute, right? He’s my favorite.]
[Oi, Kenneth. We’re not handling ordinary dogs. You should know that.]
[Maa, don’t say that. Can you give it a week? Of course, it’s not for free. I picked it up from within the Hunting Forest. 
[Fumu]
The old man stared at me with wrinkled brows.
His face is close. It’s huge. So scary. I don’t like it, but more importantly, I feel like I heard something important just now.

Eh, what, I was picked up?
Then, to the dogs who I believed to be my siblings, they aren’t connected to me by blood? They are not dogs?
*Ga~n* (TN: imagine an anime character who’s shocked and has lightning in the BG)
Maa, I did thought I looked different from my siblings. I see, so I was an abandoned dog. (TN: my hearts just went kyuun*.)
No, I’m seriously shocked.
The facts I had no idea about just came flooding in one after another.

[Isn’t it fine, Yorugen? If it still isn’t sold after one week, I’ll just come and pick it up.
[Fu~umu]

Yorugen stroked my head with his fat hand.
[Maa, it’s fine. I’ve been indebted to you, after all.]
[You saved me. I owe you one, Yorugen. I’ll find everyone a good owner. Maa, you’ve been this store’s customer so don’t worry.]
[Of course.]

The brown-haired guy picked me up and kissed me in the forehead then gave me back to Yorugen.] (TN:Aww <3)
[Stay well. Find a good master, ok?]
Un. I’ve been under your care. I wagged my tail as a sign off thanks and sent him off.

When I looked up, I was met the old man’s expressionless face.
…Ehmm, please treat me well? With that kind of meaning, I voluntarily went up to Yorugen’s arms and lifted my front leg.
Yorugen seemed to have stiffened up slightly from shock, then held out his hand to shake mine.
