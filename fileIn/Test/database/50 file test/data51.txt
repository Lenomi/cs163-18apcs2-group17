The boy's name wasSantiago . Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned 
church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the 
sacristy had once stood. 

He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and 
then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no 
wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the 
entire next day searching for it. 

He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. 
He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more 
comfortable pillows. 

It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars through the half-destroyed roof. 

I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and 
once again he had awakened before it ended. 

He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as 
soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his 
life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside 
in search of food and water. "They are so used to me that they know my schedule," he muttered. 
Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who 
had become accustomed to their schedule. 

But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, 
with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand 
what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on 
him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes 
he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed. 



But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a 
merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only 
once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded 
that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy 
about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there. 



"I need to sell some wool," the boy told the merchant. 

The shop was busy, and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon. So the boy sat on the 
steps of the shop and took a book from his bag. 

"I didn't know shepherds knew how to read," said a girl's voice behind him. 

The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia , with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the 
Moorish conquerors. 

"Well, usually I learn more from my sheep than from books," he answered. During the two hours that 
they talked, she told him she was the merchant's daughter, and spoke of life in the village, where each 
day was like all the others. The shepherd told her of the Andalusian countryside, and related the news 
from the other towns where he had stopped. It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep. 

"How did you learn to read?" the girl asked at one point. 

"Like everybody learns," he said. "In school." 

"Well, if you know how to read, why are you just a shepherd?" 

The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl 
would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went 
wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never 
end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was 
feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl 
with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again. 

But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and 
asked the shepherd to come back the following year. 



And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was excited, and at the 
same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling 
their wool. 

"It doesn't matter," he said to his sheep. "I know other girls in other places." 

But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling 
salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of 
carefree wandering. 



The day was dawning, and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun. They never have to 
make any decisions, he thought. Maybe that's why they always stay close to me. 

The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the 
best pastures inAndalusia , they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the 
seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, 
and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just 
food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and — once in a 
while — their meat. 

If I became a monster today, and decided to kill them, one by one, they would become aware only after 
most of the flock had been slaughtered, thought the boy. They trust me, and they've forgotten how to rely 
on their own instincts, because I lead them to nourishment. 

The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had 
been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to 
feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of 
the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with 
the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the 
fields. It was the time of day when all ofSpain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and 
all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, 
he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn. 

We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket's weight and warmth. 

The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of 
walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to 
explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary 
until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a 
simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, 
Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this 
was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man's sins. One afternoon, on a 
visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn't want to become a 
priest. That he wanted to travel. 



"People from all over the world have passed through this village, son," said his father. "They come in 
search of new things, but when they leave they are basically the same people they were when they 
arrived. They climb the mountain to see the castle, and they wind up thinking that the past was better than 
what we have now. They have blond hair, or dark skin, but basically they're the same as the people who 
live right here." 

"But I'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live," the boy explained. 

"Those people, when they see our land, say that they would like to live here forever," his father 
continued. 

"Well, I'd like to see their land, and see how they live," said his son. 



"The people who come here have a lot of money to spend, so they can afford to travel," his father said. 
"Amongst us, the only ones who travel are the shepherds." 

"Well, then I'll be a shepherd!" 

His father said no more. The next day, he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient Spanish gold 
coins. 

"I found these one day in the fields. I wanted them to be a part of your inheritance. But use them to buy 
your flock. Take to the fields, and someday you'll learn that our countryside is the best, and our women 
the most beautiful." 

And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his father's gaze a desire to be able, himself, to 
travel the world — a desire that was still alive, despite his father's having had to bury it, over dozens of 
years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every 
night of his life. 

The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that 
conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but 
none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he 
could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his 
dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he 
had had enough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances 
to be happy. I couldn't have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise. 

Whenever he could, he sought out a new road to travel. He had never been to that ruined church before, 
in spite of having traveled through those parts many times. The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had 
only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The 
problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the 
fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water. 

Maybe we're all that way, the boy mused. Even me — I haven't thought of other women since I met the 
merchant's daughter. Looking at the sun, he calculated that he would reach Tarifa before midday. There, 
he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to 
prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn't want to think about the possibility that some 
other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand. 

It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting, he thought, as he looked again 
at the position of the sun, and hurried his pace. He had suddenly remembered that, in Tarifa, there was an 
old woman who interpreted dreams. 



The old woman led the boy to a room at the back of her house; it was separated from her living room by 
a curtain of colored beads. The room's furnishings consisted of a table, an image of the Sacred Heart of 
Jesus, and two chairs. 

The woman sat down, and told him to be seated as well. Then she took both of his hands in hers, and 
began quietly to pray. 



It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they 
also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others. It 
was also said that they had a pact with the devil, and that they kidnapped children and, taking them away 
to their mysterious camps, made them their slaves. As a child, the boy had always been frightened to 
death that he would be captured by Gypsies, and this childhood fear returned when the old woman took 
his hands in hers. 

But she has the Sacred Heart of Jesus there, he thought, trying to reassure himself. He didn't want his 
hand to begin trembling, showing the old woman that he was fearful. He recited an Our Father silently. 

"Very interesting," said the woman, never taking her eyes from the boy's hands, and then she fell silent. 

The boy was becoming nervous. His hands began to tremble, and the woman sensed it. He quickly 
pulled his hands away. 

"I didn't come here to have you read my palm," he said, already regretting having come. He thought for a 
moment that it would be better to pay her fee and leave without learning a thing, that he was giving too 
much importance to his recurrent dream. 

"You came so that you could learn about your dreams," said the old woman. "And dreams are the 
language of God. When he speaks in our language, I can interpret what he has said. But if he speaks in 
the language of the soul, it is only you who can understand. But, whichever it is, I'm going to charge you 
for the consultation."
