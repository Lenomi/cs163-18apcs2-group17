"Well, then, we've got a problem. I can't help you if you feel you've got enough sheep." 

The boy was getting irritated. He wasn't asking for help. It was the old man who had asked for a drink 
of his wine, and had started the conversation. 

"Give me my book," the boy said. "I have to go and gather my sheep and get going." 

"Give me one-tenth of your sheep," said the old man, "and I'll tell you how to find the hidden treasure." 

The boy remembered his dream, and suddenly everything was clear to him. The old woman hadn't 
charged him anything, but the old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get 
much more money in exchange for information about something that didn't even exist. The old man was 
probably a Gypsy, too. 



But before the boy could say anything, the old man leaned over, picked up a stick, and began to write in 
the sand of the plaza. Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was 
momentarily blinded. With a movement that was too quick for someone his age, the man covered 
whatever it was with his cape. When his vision returned to normal, the boy was able to read what the old 
man had written in the sand. 

There, in the sand of the plaza of that small city, the boy read the names of his father and his mother and 
the name of the seminary he had attended. He read the name of the merchant's daughter, which he hadn't 
even known, and he read things he had never told anyone. 



"I'm the king of Salem," the old man had said. 

"Why would a king be talking with a shepherd?" the boy asked, awed and embarrassed. 

"For several reasons. But let's say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your 
destiny." 

The boy didn't know what a person's "destiny" was. 

"It's what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their 
destiny is. 

"At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, 
and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a 
mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their destiny." 

None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy. But he wanted to know what the 
"mysterious force" was; the merchant's daughter would be impressed when he told her about that! 

"It's a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize your destiny. It prepares 
your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is 
that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the 
universe. It's your mission on earth." 

"Even when all you want to do is travel? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant?" 

"Yes, or even search for treasure. The Soul of the World is nourished by people's happiness. And also 
by unhappiness, envy, and jealousy. To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation. All things 
are one. 

"And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." 

They were both silent for a time, observing the plaza and the townspeople. It was the old man who 
spoke first. 

"Why do you tend a flock of sheep?" 

"Because I like to travel." 



The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at one corner of the plaza. "When he was a 
child, that man wanted to travel, too. But he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside. 
When he's an old man, he's going to spend a month in Africa. He never realized that people are capable, 
at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of." 

"He should have decided to become a shepherd," the boy said. 

"Well, he thought about that," the old man said. "But bakers are more important people than shepherds. 
Bakers have homes, while shepherds sleep out in the open. Parents would rather see their children marry 
bakers than shepherds." 

The boy felt a pang in his heart, thinking about the merchant's daughter. There was surely a baker in her 
town. 

The old man continued, "In the long run, what people think about shepherds and bakers becomes more 
important for them than their own destinies." 

The old man leafed through the book, and fell to reading a page he came to. The boy waited, and then 
interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted. "Why are you telling me all this?" 

"Because you are trying to realize your destiny. And you are at the point where you're about to give it all 
up." 

"And that's when you always appear on the scene?" 

"Not always in this way, but I always appear in one form or another. Sometimes I appear in the form of 
a solution, or a good idea. At other times, at a crucial moment, I make it easier for things to happen. 
There are other things I do, too, but most of the time people don't realize I've done them." 

The old man related that, the week before, he had been forced to appear before a miner, and had taken 
the form of a stone. The miner had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds. For five years he 
had been working a certain river, and had examined hundreds of thousands of stones looking for an 
emerald. The miner was about to give it all up, right at the point when, if he were to examine just one 
more stone — justone more — he would find his emerald. Since the miner had sacrificed everything to his 
destiny, the old man decided to become involved. He transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to 
the miner's foot. The miner, with all the anger and frustration of his five fruitless years, picked up the stone 
and threw it aside. But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone it fell upon, and there, 
embedded in the broken stone, was the most beautiful emerald in the world. 

"People learn, early in their lives, what is their reason for being," said the old man, with a certain 
bitterness. "Maybe that's why they give up on it so early, too. But that's the way it is." 

The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure. 

"Treasure is uncovered by the force of flowing water, and it is buried by the same currents," said the old 
man. "If you want to learn about your own treasure, you will have to give me one-tenth of your flock." 

"What about one-tenth of my treasure?" 

The old man looked disappointed. "If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll 
lose your desire to work toward getting it." 



The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy. 

"Gypsies are experts at getting people to do that," sighed the old man. "In any case, it's good that you've 
learned that everything in life has its price. This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach." 

The old man returned the book to the boy. 

"Tomorrow, at this same time, bring me a tenth of your flock. And I will tell you how to find the hidden 
treasure. Good afternoon." 

And he vanished around the comer of the plaza. 



The boy began again to read his book, but he was no longer able to concentrate. He was tense and 
upset, because he knew that the old man was right. He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of 
bread, thinking about whether or not he should tell the baker what the old man had said about him. 
Sometimes it's better to leave things as they are, he thought to himself, and decided to say nothing. If he 
were to say anything, the baker would spend three days thinking about giving it all up, even though he 
had gotten used to the way things were. The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the 
baker. So he began to wander through the city, and found himself at the gates. There was a small building 
there, with a window at which people bought tickets to Africa. And he knew that Egypt was in Africa. 

"Can I help you?" asked the man behind the window. 

"Maybe tomorrow," said the boy, moving away. If he sold just one of his sheep, he'd have enough to get 
to the other shore of the strait. The idea frightened him. 

"Another dreamer," said the ticket seller to his assistant, watching the boy walk away. "He doesn't have 
enough money to travel." 

While standing at the ticket window, the boy had remembered his flock, and decided he should go back 
to being a shepherd. In two years he had learned everything about shepherding: he knew how to shear 
sheep, how to care for pregnant ewes, and how to protect the sheep from wolves. He knew all the fields 
and pastures of Andalusia. And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals. 

He decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible. As he walked past the city's 
castle, he interrupted his return, and climbed the stone ramp that led to the top of the wall. From there, he 
could see Africa in the distance. Someone had once told him that it was from there that the Moors had 
come, to occupy all of Spain. 

He could see almost the entire city from where he sat, including the plaza where he had talked with the 
old man. Curse the moment I met that old man, he thought. He had come to the town only to find a 
woman who could interpret his dream. Neither the woman nor the old man were at all impressed by the 
fact that he was a shepherd. They were solitary individuals who no longer believed in things, and didn't 
understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep. He knew everything about each member of 
his flock: he knew which ones were lame, which one was to give birth two months from now, and which 
were the laziest. He knew how to shear them, and how to slaughter them. If he ever decided to leave 
them, they would suffer. 



The wind began to pick up. He knew that wind: people called it the levanter, because on it the Moors 
had come from the Levant at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. 

The levanter increased in intensity. Here I am, between my flock and my treasure, the boy thought. He 
had to choose between something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted to have. 
There was also the merchant's daughter, but she wasn't as important as his flock, because she didn't 
depend on him. Maybe she didn't even remember him. He was sure that it made no difference to her on 
which day he appeared: for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next, it's 
because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises. 

I left my father, my mother, and the town castle behind. They have gotten used to my being away, and 
so have I. The sheep will get used to my not being there, too, the boy thought. 

From where he sat, he could observe the plaza. People continued to come and go from the baker's 
shop. A young couple sat on the bench where he had talked with the old man, and they kissed. 

"That baker. . ." he said to himself, without completing the thought. The levanter was still getting stronger, 
and he felt its force on his face. That wind had brought the Moors, yes, but it had also brought the smell 
of the desert and of veiled women. It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once 
left to search for the unknown, and for gold and adventure — and for the Pyramids. The boy felt jealous 
of the freedom of the wind, and saw that he could have the same freedom. There was nothing to hold him 
back except himself. The sheep, the merchant's daughter, and the fields of Andalusia were only steps 
along the way to his destiny. 

The next day, the boy met the old man at noon. He brought six sheep with him. 

"I'm surprised," the boy said. "My friend bought all the other sheep immediately. He said that he had 
always dreamed of being a shepherd, and that it was a good omen." 



"That's the way it always is," said the old man. "It's called the principle of favorability. When you play 
cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner's luck." 

"Why is that?" 

"Because there is a force that wants you to realize your destiny; it whets your appetite with a taste of 
success." 

Then the old man began to inspect the sheep, and he saw that one was lame. The boy explained that it 
wasn't important, since that sheep was the most intelligent of the flock, and produced the most wool. 

"Where is the treasure?" he asked. 

"It's in Egypt, near the Pyramids." 

The boy was startled. The old woman had said the same thing. But she hadn't charged him anything. 

"In order to find the treasure, you will have to follow the omens. God has prepared a path for everyone 
to follow. You just have to read the omens that he left for you." 

Before the boy could reply, a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man. He 
remembered something his grandfather had once told him: that butterflies were a good omen. Like 



crickets, and like expectations; like lizards and four-leaf clovers. 

"That's right," said the old man, able to read the boy's thoughts. "Just as your grandfather taught you. 
These are good omens." 

The old man opened his cape, and the boy was struck by what he saw. The old man wore a breastplate 
of heavy gold, covered with precious stones. The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the 
previous day.
