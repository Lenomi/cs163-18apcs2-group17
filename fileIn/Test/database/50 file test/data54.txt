The boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby, listening attentively to their conversation. He felt 
uneasy at the man's presence. But he had found a guide, and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity. 

"You have to cross the entire Sahara desert," said the young man. "And to do that, you need money. I 
need to know whether you have enough." 

The boy thought it a strange question. But he trusted in the old man, who had said that, when you really 
want something, the universe always conspires in your favor. 

He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young man. The owner of the bar came over 
and looked, as well. The two men exchanged some words in Arabic, and the bar owner seemed irritated. 

"Let's get out of here" said the new arrival. "He wants us to leave." 

The boy was relieved. He got up to pay the bill, but the owner grabbed him and began to speak to him 
in an angry stream of words. The boy was strong, and wanted to retaliate, but he was in a foreign 
country. His new friend pushed the owner aside, and pulled the boy outside with him. "He wanted your 
money," he said. "Tangier is not like the rest of Africa. This is a port, and every port has its thieves." 

The boy trusted his new friend. He had helped him out in a dangerous situation. He took out his money 
and counted it. 

"We could get to the Pyramids by tomorrow," said the other, taking the money. "But I have to buy two 
camels." 

They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier. Everywhere there were stalls with items for 
sale. They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held. There were thousands of 
people there, arguing, selling, and buying; vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed 
alongside tobacco. But the boy never took his eye off his new friend. After all, he had all his money. He 
thought about asking him to give it back, but decided that would be unfriendly. He knew nothing about 
the customs of the strange land he was in. 

"I'll just watch him," he said to himself. He knew he was stronger than his friend. 

Suddenly, there in the midst of all that confusion, he saw the most beautiful sword he had ever seen. The 
scabbard was embossed in silver, and the handle was black and encrusted with precious stones. The boy 
promised himself that, when he returned from Egypt, he would buy that sword. 

"Ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs," he said to his friend. Then he realized that he 
had been distracted for a few moments, looking at the sword. His heart squeezed, as if his chest had 
suddenly compressed it. He was afraid to look around, because he knew what he would find. He 
continued to look at the beautiful sword for a bit longer, until he summoned the courage to turn around. 

All around him was the market, with people coming and going, shouting and buying, and the aroma of 
strange foods. . . but nowhere could he find his new companion. 

The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident. He 
decided to stay right there and await his return. As he waited, a priest climbed to the top of a nearby 
tower and began his chant; everyone in the market fell to their knees, touched their foreheads to the 
ground, and took up the chant. Then, like a colony of worker ants, they dismantled their stalls and left. 



The sun began its departure, as well. The boy watched it through its trajectory for some time, until it was 
hidden behind the white houses surrounding the plaza. He recalled that when the sun had risen that 
morning, he was on another continent, still a shepherd with sixty sheep, and looking forward to meeting 
with a girl. That morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him as he walked through 
the familiar fields. But now, as the sun began to set, he was in a different country, a stranger in a strange 
land, where he couldn't even speak the language. He was no longer a shepherd, and he had nothing, not 
even the money to return and start everything over. 

All this happened between sunrise and sunset, the boy thought. He was feeling sorry for himself, and 
lamenting the fact that his life could have changed so suddenly and so drastically. 

He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry. He had never even wept in front of his own sheep. But the 
marketplace was empty, and he was far from home, so he wept. He wept because God was unfair, and 
because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams. 

When I had my sheep, I was happy, and I made those around me happy. People saw me coming and 
welcomed me, he thought. But now I'm sad and alone. I'm going to become bitter and distrustful of 
people because one person betrayed me. I'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because 
I never found mine. And I'm going to hold on to what little I have, because I'm too insignificant to 
conquer the world. 

He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich 
he had eaten on the ship. But all he found was the heavy book, his jacket, and the two stones the old 
man had given him. 

As he looked at the stones, he felt relieved for some reason. He had exchanged six sheep for two 
precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate. He could sell the stones and buy a return 
ticket. But this time I'll be smarter, the boy thought, removing them from the pouch so he could put them 
in his pocket. This was a port town, and the only truthful thing his friend had told him was that port towns 
are full of thieves. 

Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset: he was trying to tell him not to trust 
that man. "I'm like everyone else — I see the world in terms of what I would like to see happen, not what 
actually does." 

He ran his fingers slowly over the stones, sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces. They were 
his treasure. Just handling them made him feel better. They reminded him of the old man. 

"When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it," he had said. 

The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man had said. There he was in the empty 
marketplace, without a cent to his name, and with not a sheep to guard through the night. But the stones 
were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy's past. 

"They're called Urim and Thummim, and they can help you to read the omens." The boy put the stones 
back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment. The old man had said to ask very clear questions, 
and to do that, the boy had to know what he wanted. So, he asked if the old man's blessing was still with 
him. 

He took out one of the stones. It was "yes." 



"Am I going to find my treasure?" he asked. 

He stuck his hand into the pouch, and felt around for one of the stones. As he did so, both of them 
pushed through a hole in the pouch and fell to the ground. The boy had never even noticed that there was 
a hole in his pouch. He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch. But as he 
saw them lying there on the ground, another phrase came to his mind. 

"Learn to recognize omens, and follow them," the old king had said. 

An omen. The boy smiled to himself. He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch. He 
didn't consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted. He had learned 
that there were certain things one shouldn't ask about, so as not to flee from one's own destiny. "I 
promised that I would make my own decisions," he said to himself. 

But the stones had told him that the old man was still with him, and that made him feel more confident. 
He looked around at the empty plaza again, feeling less desperate than before. This wasn't a strange 
place; it was a new one. 

After all, what he had always wanted was just that: to know new places. Even if he never got to the 
Pyramids, he had already traveled farther than any shepherd he knew. Oh, if they only knew how 
different things are just two hours by ship from where they are, he thought. Although his new world at the 
moment was just an empty marketplace, he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he 
would never forget it. He remembered the sword. It hurt him a bit to think about it, but he had never seen 
one like it before. As he mused about these things, he realized that he had to choose between thinking of 
himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure. 

"I'm an adventurer, looking for treasure," he said to himself. 



He was shaken into wakefulness by someone. He had fallen asleep in the middle of the marketplace, and 
life in the plaza was about to resume. 

Looking around, he sought his sheep, and then realized that he was in a new world. But instead of being 
saddened, he was happy. He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep; he could go in 
search of his treasure, instead. He had not a cent in his pocket, but he had faith. He had decided, the 
night before, that he would be as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books. 

He walked slowly through the market. The merchants were assembling their stalls, and the boy helped a 
candy seller to do his. The candy seller had a smile on his face: he was happy, aware of what his life was 
about, and ready to begin a day's work. His smile reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old 
king he had met. "This candy merchant isn't making candy so that later he can travel or marry a 
shopkeeper's daughter. He's doing it because it's what he wants to do," thought the boy. He realized that 
he could do the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his 
destiny. Just by looking at them. It's easy, and yet I've never done it before, he thought. 

When the stall was assembled, the candy seller offered the boy the first sweet he had made for the day. 
The boy thanked him, ate it, and went on his way. When he had gone only a short distance, he realized 
that, while they were erecting the stall, one of them had spoken Arabic and the other Spanish. 

And they had understood each other perfectly well. 



There must be a language that doesn't depend on words, the boy thought. I've already had that 
experience with my sheep, and now it's happening with people. 

He was learning a lot of new things. Some of them were things that he had already experienced, and 
weren't really new, but that he had never perceived before. And he hadn't perceived them because he 
had become accustomed to them. He realized: If I can learn to understand this language without words, I 
can learn to understand the world. 

Relaxed and unhurried, he resolved that he would walk through the narrow streets of Tangier. Only in 
that way would he be able to read the omens. He knew it would require a lot of patience, but shepherds 
know all about patience. Once again he saw that, in that strange land, he was applying the same lessons 
he had learned with his sheep. 

"All things are one," the old man had said. 



The crystal merchant awoke with the day, and felt the same anxiety that he felt every morning. He had 
been in the same place for thirty years: a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed. 
Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell 
crystal glassware. There had been a time when many people knew of his shop: Arab merchants, French 
and English geologists, German soldiers who were always well-heeled. In those days it had been 
wonderful to be selling crystal, and he had thought how he would become rich, and have beautiful women 
at his side as he grew older. 

But, as time passed, Tangier had changed. The nearby city of Ceuta had grown faster than Tangier, and 
business had fallen off. Neighbors moved away, and there remained only a few small shops on the hill. 
And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops. 

But the crystal merchant had no choice. He had lived thirty years of his life buying and selling crystal 
pieces, and now it was too late to do anything else. 

He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street. He had done this 
for years, and knew the schedule of everyone who passed. But, just before lunchtime, a boy stopped in 
front of the shop. He was dressed normally, but the practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that 
the boy had no money to spend. Nevertheless, the merchant decided to delay his lunch for a few minutes 
until the boy moved on. 



A card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop. The boy saw 
a man appear behind the counter. 

"I can clean up those glasses in the window, if you want," said the boy. "The way they look now, 
nobody is going to want to buy them." 

The man looked at him without responding. 

"In exchange, you could give me something to eat." 



The man still said nothing, and the boy sensed that he was going to have to make a decision. In his 
pouch, he had his jacket — he certainly wasn't going to need it in the desert. Taking the jacket out, he 
began to clean the glasses. In half an hour, he had cleaned all the glasses in the window, and, as he was 
doing so, two customers had entered the shop and bought some crystal. 

When he had completed the cleaning, he asked the man for something to eat. "Let's go and have some 
lunch," said the crystal merchant. 

He put a sign on the door, and they went to a small cafe nearby. As they sat down at the only table in 
the place, the crystal merchant laughed. 

"You didn't have to do any cleaning," he said. "The Koran requires me to feed a hungry person." 

"Well then, why did you let me do it?" the boy asked. 

"Because the crystal was dirty. And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts." 

When they had eaten, the merchant turned to the boy and said, "I'd like you to work in my shop. Two 
customers came in today while you were working, and that's a good omen." 

People talk a lot about omens, thought the shepherd. But they really don't know what they're saying. Just 
as I hadn't realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep. 

"Do you want to go to work for me?" the merchant asked. 

"I can work for the rest of today," the boy answered. "I'll work all night, until dawn, and I'll clean every 
piece of crystal in your shop. In return, I need money to get to Egypt tomorrow." 

The merchant laughed. "Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year. . . even if you earned a good 
commission selling every piece, you would still have to borrow money to get to Egypt. There are 
thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there." 

There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the city was asleep. No sound from the 
bazaars, no arguments among the merchants, no men climbing to the towers to chant. No hope, no 
adventure, no old kings or destinies, no treasure, and no Pyramids. It was as if the world had fallen silent 
because the boy's soul had. He sat there, staring blankly through the door of the cafe, wishing that he had 
died, and that everything would end forever at that moment. 

The merchant looked anxiously at the boy. All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly 
disappeared. 

"I can give you the money you need to get back to your country, my son," said the crystal merchant. 

The boy said nothing. He got up, adjusted his clothing, and picked up his pouch. 

"I'll work for you," he said. 

And after another long silence, he added, "I need money to buy some sheep."
