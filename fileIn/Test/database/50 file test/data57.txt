"I'm the leader of the caravan," said a dark-eyed, bearded man. "I hold the power of life and death for 
every person I take with me. The desert is a capricious lady, and sometimes she drives men crazy." 

There were almost two hundred people gathered there, and four hundred animals — camels, horses, 
mules, and fowl. In the crowd were women, children, and a number of men with swords at their belts and 
rifles slung on their shoulders. The Englishman had several suitcases filled with books. There was a 



babble of noise, and the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he 
was saying. 

"There are a lot of different people here, and each has his own God. But the only God I serve is Allah, 
and in his name I swear that I will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert. But I 
want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no 
matter what. In the desert, disobedience means death." 

There was a murmur from the crowd. Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God. The boy swore 
to Jesus Christ. The Englishman said nothing. And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would 
have. The people were also praying to heaven for protection. 

A long note was sounded on a bugle, and everyone mounted up. The boy and the Englishman had 
bought camels, and climbed uncertainly onto their backs. The boy felt sorry for the Englishman's camel, 
loaded down as he was with the cases of books. 

"There's no such thing as coincidence," said the Englishman, picking up the conversation where it had 
been interrupted in the warehouse. "I'm here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who. . . " 

But the caravan began to move, and it was impossible to hear what the Englishman was saying. The boy 
knew what he was about to describe, though: the mysterious chain that links one thing to another, the 
same chain that had caused him to become a shepherd, that had caused his recurring dream, that had 
brought him to a city near Africa, to find a king, and to be robbed in order to meet a crystal merchant, 
and... 

The closer one gets to realizing his destiny, the more that destiny becomes his true reason for being, 
thought the boy. 

The caravan moved toward the east. It traveled during the morning, halted when the sun was at its 
strongest, and resumed late in the afternoon. The boy spoke very little with the Englishman, who spent 
most of his time with his books. 

The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert. Now everything 
was quite different from how it was that day they had set out: then, there had been confusion and 
shouting, the cries of children and the whinnying of animals, all mixed with the nervous orders of the 
guides and the merchants. 

But, in the desert, there was only the sound of the eternal wind, and of the hoofbeats of the animals. 
Even the guides spoke very little to one another. 

"I've crossed these sands many times," said one of the camel drivers one night. "But the desert is so 
huge, and the horizons so distant, that they make a person feel small, and as if he should remain silent." 

The boy understood intuitively what he meant, even without ever having set foot in the desert before. 
Whenever he saw the sea, or a fire, he fell silent, impressed by their elemental force. 

I've learned things from the sheep, and I've learned things from crystal, he thought. I can learn something 
from the desert, too. It seems old and wise. 

The wind never stopped, and the boy remembered the day he had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same 
wind blowing in his face. It reminded him of the wool from his sheep. . . his sheep who were now seeking 



food and water in the fields of Andalusia, as they always had. 

"They're not my sheep anymore," he said to himself, without nostalgia. "They must be used to their new 
shepherd, and have probably already forgotten me. That's good. Creatures like the sheep, that are used 
to traveling, know about moving on." 

He thought of the merchant's daughter, and was sure that she had probably married. Perhaps to a baker, 
or to another shepherd who could read and could tell her exciting stories — after all, he probably wasn't 
the only one. But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver's comment: maybe he 
was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the present of all people. "Hunches," 
his mother used to call them. The boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden 
immersion of the soul into the universal current of life, where the histories of all people are connected, and 
we are able to know everything, because it's all written there. 

"Maktub" the boy said, remembering the crystal merchant. 

The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a 
boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the 
sand was too fine for the animals' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In 
some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places, 
and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges. The drivers carried the freight 
themselves over such treacherous footing, and then reloaded the camels. If a guide were to fall ill or die, 
the camel drivers would draw lots and appoint a new one. 

But all this happened for one basic reason: no matter how many detours and adjustments it made, the 
caravan moved toward the same compass point. Once obstacles were overcome, it returned to its 
course, sighting on a star that indicated the location of the oasis. When the people saw that star shining in 
the morning sky, they knew they were on the right course toward water, palm trees, shelter, and other 
people. It was only the Englishman who was unaware of all this; he was, for the most part, immersed in 
reading his books. 

The boy, too, had his book, and he had tried to read it during the first few days of the journey. But he 
found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind. As soon as he had learned 
to know his camel better, and to establish a relationship with him, he threw the book away. Although the 
boy had developed a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn something 
important, he decided it was an unnecessary burden. 

He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him. At night, as they sat around the 
fire, the boy related to the driver his adventures as a shepherd. 

During one of these conversations, the driver told of his own life. 

"I used to live near El Cairum," he said. "I had my orchard, my children, and a life that would change not 
at all until I died. One year, when the crop was the best ever, we all went to Mecca, and I satisfied the 
only unmet obligation in my life. I could die happily, and that made me feel good. 

"One day, the earth began to tremble, and the Nile overflowed its banks. It was something that I thought 
could happen only to others, never to me. My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive trees in the 
flood, and my wife was afraid that we would lose our children. I thought that everything I owned would 
be destroyed. 



"The land was ruined, and I had to find some other way to earn a living. So now I'm a camel driver. But 
that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah: people need not fear the unknown if they are 
capable of achieving what they need and want. 

"We are afraid of losing what we have, whether it's our life or our possessions and property. But this 
fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the 
same hand." 

Sometimes, their caravan met with another. One always had something that the other needed — as if 
everything were indeed written by one hand. As they sat around the fire, the camel drivers exchanged 
information about windstorms, and told stories about the desert. 

At other times, mysterious, hooded men would appear; they were Bedouins who did surveillance along 
the caravan route. They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes. They came in silence and 
departed the same way, dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes. One night, a camel driver 
came to the fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting. "There are rumors of tribal wars," he told 
them. 

The three fell silent. The boy noted that there was a sense of fear in the air, even though no one said 
anything. Once again he was experiencing the language without words. . . the universal language. 

The Englishman asked if they were in danger. 

"Once you get into the desert, there's no going back," said the camel driver. "And, when you can't go 
back, you have to worry only about the best way of moving forward. The rest is up to Allah, including 
the danger." 

And he concluded by saying the mysterious word: "Maktub" 

"You should pay more attention to the caravan," the boy said to the Englishman, after the camel driver 
had left. "We make a lot of detours, but we're always heading for the same destination." 

"And you ought to read more about the world," answered the Englishman. "Books are like caravans in 
that respect." 

The immense collection of people and animals began to travel faster. The days had always been silent, 
but now, even the nights — when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — had also 
become quiet. And, one day, the leader of the caravan made the decision that the fires should no longer 
be lighted, so as not to attract attention to the caravan. 

The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a circle at night, sleeping together in the 
center as protection against the nocturnal cold. And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the 
group. 

The Englishman was unable to sleep one night. He called to the boy, and they took a walk along the 
dunes surrounding the encampment. There was a full moon, and the boy told the Englishman the story of 
his life. 

The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the 
boy began working there.
