The boy couldn't believe what he was seeing: the oasis, rather than being just a well surrounded by a few 
palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back in 
Spain. There were three hundred wells, fifty thousand date trees, and innumerable colored tents spread 
among them. 

"It looks ]ikeThe Thousand and One Nights ," said the Englishman, impatient to meet with the 
alchemist. 

They were surrounded by children, curious to look at the animals and people that were arriving. The 
men of the oasis wanted to know if they had seen any fighting, and the women competed with one 
another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants. The silence of the desert 
was a distant dream; the travelers in the caravan were talking incessantly, laughing and shouting, as if they 
had emerged from the spiritual world and found themselves once again in the world of people. They were 
relieved and happy. 

They had been taking careful precautions in the desert, but the camel driver explained to the boy that 
oases were always considered to be neutral territories, because the majority of the inhabitants were 
women and children. There were oases throughout the desert, but the tribesmen fought in the desert, 
leaving the oases as places of refuge. 

With some difficulty, the leader of the caravan brought all his people together and gave them his 
instructions. The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was over. 
Since they were visitors, they would have to share living space with those who lived there, and would be 
given the best accommodations. That was the law of hospitality. Then he asked that everyone, including 
his own sentinels, hand over their arms to the men appointed by the tribal chieftains. 

"Those are the rules of war," the leader explained. "The oases may not shelter armies or troops." 

To the boy's surprise, the Englishman took a chrome-plated revolver out of his bag and gave it to the 
men who were collecting the arms. 

"Why a revolver?" he asked. 

"It helped me to trust in people," the Englishman answered. 

Meanwhile, the boy thought about his treasure. The closer he got to the realization of his dream, the 
more difficult things became. It seemed as if what the old king had called "beginner's luck" were no longer 
functioning. In his pursuit of the dream, he was being constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and 
courage. So he could not be hasty, nor impatient. If he pushed forward impulsively, he would fail to see 
the signs and omens left by God along his path. 

God placed them along my path. He had surprised himself with the thought. Until then, he had 
considered the omens to be things of this world. Like eating or sleeping, or like seeking love or finding a 
job. He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do. 

"Don't be impatient," he repeated to himself. "It's like the camel driver said: Eat when it's time to eat. 
And move along when it's time to move along.' " 

That first day, everyone slept from exhaustion, including the Englishman. The boy was assigned a place 



far from his friend, in a tent with five other young men of about his age. They were people of the desert, 
and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities. 

The boy told them about his life as a shepherd, and was about to tell them of his experiences at the 
crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent. 

"I've been looking for you all morning," he said, as he led the boy outside. "I need you to help me find 
out where the alchemist lives." 

First, they tried to find him on their own. An alchemist would probably live in a manner that was different 
from that of the rest of the people at the oasis, and it was likely that in his tent an oven was continuously 
burning. They searched everywhere, and found that the oasis was much larger than they could have 
imagined; there were hundreds of tents. 

"We've wasted almost the entire day," said the Englishman, sitting down with the boy near one of the 
wells. 

"Maybe we'd better ask someone," the boy suggested. 

The Englishman didn't want to tell others about his reasons for being at the oasis, and couldn't make up 
his mind. But, finally, he agreed that the boy, who spoke better Arabic than he, should do so. The boy 
approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water. 

"Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm trying to find out where the alchemist lives here at the oasis." 

The woman said she had never heard of such a person, and hurried away. But before she fled, she 
advised the boy that he had better not try to converse with women who were dressed in black, because 
they were married women. He should respect tradition. 

The Englishman was disappointed. It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing. The boy was 
also saddened; his friend was in pursuit of his destiny. And, when someone was in such pursuit, the entire 
universe made an effort to help him succeed — that's what the old king had said. He couldn't have been 
wrong. 

"I had never heard of alchemists before," the boy said. "Maybe no one here has, either." 

The Englishman's eyes lit up. "That's it! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is! Find out who it 
is who cures the people's illnesses!" 

Several women dressed in black came to the well for water, but the boy would speak to none of them, 
despite the Englishman's insistence. Then a man approached. 

"Do you know someone here who cures people's illnesses?" the boy asked. 

"Allah cures our illnesses," said the man, clearly frightened of the strangers. "You're looking for witch 
doctors." He spoke some verses from the Koran, and moved on. 

Another man appeared. He was older, and was carrying a small bucket. The boy repeated his question. 

"Why do you want to find that sort of person?" the Arab asked. 



"Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order to meet with him," the boy said. 

"If such a man is here at the oasis, he must be the very powerful one," said the old man after thinking for 
a few moments. "Not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to. Only when he 
consents. 

"Wait for the end of the war. Then leave with the caravan. Don't try to enter into the life of the oasis," he 
said, and walked away. 

But the Englishman was exultant. They were on the right track. 

Finally, a young woman approached who was not dressed in black. She had a vessel on her shoulder, 
and her head was covered by a veil, but her face was uncovered. The boy approached her to ask about 
the alchemist. 

At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. 
When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he 
learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on 
earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more 
ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had 
theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen — the omen he had been awaiting, 
without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his 
books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert. 

It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it 
travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only 
woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain 
of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in 
love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had 
never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it's easy to understand that 
someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when 
two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. 
There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by 
one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. 
Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning. 

Maktub , thought the boy. 

The Englishman shook the boy: "Come on, ask her!" 

The boy stepped closer to the girl, and when she smiled, he did the same. 

"What's your name?" he asked. 

"Fatima," the girl said, averting her eyes. 

"That's what some women in my country are called." 



"It's the name of the Prophet's daughter," Fatima said. "The invaders carried the name everywhere." The 
beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride. 



The Englishman prodded him, and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses. 

"That's the man who knows all the secrets of the world," she said. "He communicates with the genies of 
the desert." 

The genies were the spirits of good and evil. And the girl pointed to the south, indicating that it was there 
the strange man lived. Then she filled her vessel with water and left. 

The Englishman vanished, too, gone to find the alchemist. And the boy sat there by the well for a long 
time, remembering that one day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that woman, and 
realizing that he had loved her before he even knew she existed. He knew that his love for her would 
enable him to discover every treasure in the world. 

The next day, the boy returned to the well, hoping to see the girl. To his surprise, the Englishman was 
there, looking out at the desert, 

"I waited all afternoon and evening," he said. "He appeared with the first stars of evening. I told him what 
I was seeking, and he asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold. I told him that was what I had 
come here to learn. 

"He told me I should try to do so. That's all he said: 'Go and try.' " 

The boy didn't say anything. The poor Englishman had traveled all this way, only to be told that he 
should repeat what he had already done so many times. 

"So, then try," he said to the Englishman. 

"That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to start now." 

As the Englishman left, Fatima arrived and filled her vessel with water. 

"I came to tell you just one thing," the boy said. "I want you to be my wife. I love you." 

The girl dropped the container, and the water spilled. 

"I'm going to wait here for you every day. I have crossed the desert in search of a treasure that is 
somewhere near the Pyramids, and for me, the war seemed a curse. But now it's a blessing, because it 
brought me to you." 

"The war is going to end someday," the girl said. 

The boy looked around him at the date palms. He reminded himself that he had been a shepherd, and 
that he could be a shepherd again. Fatima was more important than his treasure. 

"The tribesmen are always in search of treasure," the girl said, as if she had guessed what he was 
thinking. "And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen." 

She refilled her vessel and left.
