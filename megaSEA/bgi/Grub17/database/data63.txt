"Now leave us alone," said the boy to the young Arab. The Arab returned to his tent to sleep, proud to 
have helped the counselor of the oasis, and happy at having enough money to buy himself some sheep. 

Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent. The two walked out among the palms. The boy knew that it 
was a violation of the Tradition, but that didn't matter to him now. 

"I'm going away," he said. "And I want you to know that I'm coming back. I love you because. . . " 

"Don't say anything," Fatima interrupted. "One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for 
loving." 

But the boy continued, "I had a dream, and I met with a king. I sold crystal and crossed the desert. And, 
because the tribes declared war, I went to the well, seeking the alchemist. So, I love you because the 
entire universe conspired to help me find you." 

The two embraced. It was the first time either had touched the other. 

"I'll be back," the boy said. 

"Before this, I always looked to the desert with longing," said Fatima. "Now it will be with hope. My 
father went away one day, but he returned to my mother, and he has always come back since then." 

They said nothing else. They walked a bit farther among the palms, and then the boy left her at the 



entrance to her tent. 

"I'll return, just as your father came back to your mother," he said. 

He saw that Fatima's eyes were filled with tears. 

"You're crying?" 

"I'm a woman of the desert," she said, averting her face. "But above all, I'm a woman." 

Fatima went back to her tent, and, when daylight came, she went out to do the chores she had done for 
years. But everything had changed. The boy was no longer at the oasis, and the oasis would never again 
have the same meaning it had had only yesterday. It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm 
trees and three hundred wells, where the pilgrims arrived, relieved at the end of their long journeys. From 
that day on, the oasis would be an empty place for her. 

From that day on, it was the desert that would be important. She would look to it every day, and would 
try to guess which star the boy was following in search of his treasure. She would have to send her kisses 
on the wind, hoping that the wind would touch the boy's face, and would tell him that she was alive. That 
she was waiting for him, a woman awaiting a courageous man in search of his treasure. From that day on, 
the desert would represent only one thing to her: the hope for his return. 



"Don't think about what you've left behind," the alchemist said to the boy as they began to ride across 
the sands of the desert. "Everything is written in the Soul of the World, and there it will stay forever." 

"Men dream more about coming home than about leaving," the boy said. He was already reaccustomed 
to desert's silence. 

"If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil. And one can always come back. If what 
you had found was only a moment of light, like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your 
return." 

The man was speaking the language of alchemy. But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima. 

It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him 
to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman he loved. He 
could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. 
Maybe the alchemist has never been in love, the boy thought. 

The alchemist rode in front, with the falcon on his shoulder. The bird knew the language of the desert 
well, and whenever they stopped, he flew off in search of game. On the first day he returned with a 
rabbit, and on the second with two birds. 

At night, they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden. The desert nights were cold, and 
were becoming darker and darker as the phases of the moon passed. They went on for a week, 
speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to avoid the battles between the tribes. 
The war continued, and at times the wind carried the sweet, sickly smell of blood. Battles had been 
fought nearby, and the wind reminded the boy that there was the language of omens, always ready to 
show him what his eyes had failed to observe. 



On the seventh day, the alchemist decided to make camp earlier than usual. The falcon flew off to find 
game, and the alchemist offered his water container to the boy. 

"You are almost at the end of your journey," said the alchemist. "I congratulate you for having pursued 
your destiny." 

"And you've told me nothing along the way," said the boy. "I thought you were going to teach me some 
of the things you know. A while ago, I rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy. 
But I wasn't able to learn anything from them." 

"There is only one way to learn," the alchemist answered. "It's through action. Everything you need to 
know you have learned through your journey. You need to learn only one thing more." 

The boy wanted to know what that was, but the alchemist was searching the horizon, looking for the 
falcon. 

"Why are you called the alchemist?" 

"Because that's what I am." 

"And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so?" 

"They were looking only for gold," his companion answered. "They were seeking the treasure of their 
destiny, without wanting actually to live out the destiny." 

"What is it that I still need to know?" the boy asked. 

But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon. And finally the falcon returned with their meal. They 
dug a hole and lit their fire in it, so that the light of the flames would not be seen. 

"I'm an alchemist simply because I'm an alchemist," he said, as he prepared the meal. "I learned the 
science from my grandfather, who learned from his father, and so on, back to the creation of the world. 
In those times, the Master Work could be written simply on an emerald. But men began to reject simple 
things, and to write tracts, interpretations, and philosophical studies. They also began to feel that they 
knew a better way than others had. Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today." 

"What was written on the Emerald Tablet?" the boy wanted to know. 

The alchemist began to draw in the sand, and completed his drawing in less than five minutes. As he 
drew, the boy thought of the old king, and the plaza where they had met that day; it seemed as if it had 
taken place years and years ago. 

"This is what was written on the Emerald Tablet," said the alchemist, when he had finished. 

The boy tried to read what was written in the sand. 

"It's a code," said the boy, a bit disappointed. "It looks like what I saw in the Englishman's books." 

"No," the alchemist answered. "It's like the flight of those two hawks; it can't be understood by reason 
alone. The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World. 



"The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise. The existence 
of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect. God created the world so that, 
through its visible objects, men could understand his spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom. 
That's what I mean by action." 

"Should I understand the Emerald Tablet?" the boy asked. 

"Perhaps, if you were in a laboratory of alchemy, this would be the right time to study the best way to 
understand the Emerald Tablet. But you are in the desert. So immerse yourself in it. The desert will give 
you an understanding of the world; in fact, anything on the face of the earth will do that. You don't even 
have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see 
in it all the marvels of creation." 

"How do I immerse myself in the desert?" 

"Listen to your heart. It knows all things, because it came from the Soul of the World, and it will one day 
return there." 



They crossed the desert for another two days in silence. The alchemist had become much more cautious, 
because they were approaching the area where the most violent battles were being waged. As they 
moved along, the boy tried to listen to his heart. 

It was not easy to do; in earlier times, his heart had always been ready to tell its story, but lately that 
wasn't true. There had been times when his heart spent hours telling of its sadness, and at other times it 
became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears. His heart beat fastest 
when it spoke to the boy of treasure, and more slowly when the boy stared entranced at the endless 
horizons of the desert. But his heart was never quiet, even when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into 
silence. 

"Why do we have to listen to our hearts?" the boy asked, when they had made camp that day. 

"Because, wherever your heart is, that is where you'll find your treasure." 

"But my heart is agitated," the boy said. "It has its dreams, it gets emotional, and it's become passionate 
over a woman of the desert. It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when I'm 
thinking about her." 

"Well, that's good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say." 

During the next three days, the two travelers passed by a number of armed tribesmen, and saw others 
on the horizon. The boy's heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of 
the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened 
the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other 
times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches. 

"My heart is a traitor," the boy said to the alchemist, when they had paused to rest the horses. "It doesn't 
want me to go on." 



"That makes sense," the alchemist answered. "Naturally it's afraid that, in pursuing your dream, you might 
lose everything you've won." 

"Well, then, why should I listen to my heart?" 

"Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet. Even if you pretend not to have heard what it tells 
you, it will always be there inside you, repeating to you what you're thinking about life and about the 
world." 

"You mean I should listen, even if it's treasonous?" 

"Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly. If you know your heart well, it will never be able to do that 
to you. Because you'll know its dreams and wishes, and will know how to deal with them. 

"You will never be able to escape from your heart. So it's better to listen to what it has to say. That way, 
you'll never have to fear an unanticipated blow." 

The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert. He came to understand its dodges 
and tricks, and to accept it as it was. He lost his fear, and forgot about his need to go back to the oasis, 
because, one afternoon, his heart told him that it was happy. "Even though I complain sometimes," it said, 
"it's because I'm the heart of a person, and people's hearts are that way. People are afraid to pursue their 
most important dreams, because they feel that they don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to 
achieve them. We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of 
moments that could have been good but weren't, or of treasures that might have been found but were 
forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly." 

"My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer," the boy told the alchemist one night as they looked up at 
the moonless sky. 

"Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever 
suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second's encounter 
with God and with eternity." 

"Every second of the search is an encounter with God," the boy told his heart. "When I have been truly 
searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because I've known that every hour was a part 
of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, I've discovered things 
along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed 
impossible for a shepherd to achieve." 

So his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon. That night, the boy slept deeply, and, when he awoke, his 
heart began to tell him things that came from the Soul of the World. It said that all people who are happy 
have God within them. And that happiness could be found in a grain of sand from the desert, as the 
alchemist had said. Because a grain of sand is a moment of creation, and the universe has taken millions 
of years to create it. "Everyone on earth has a treasure that awaits him," his heart said. "We, people's 
hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them. 
We speak of them only to children. Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own 
fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them — the path to their destinies, and to 
happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, 
indeed, to be a threatening place.
