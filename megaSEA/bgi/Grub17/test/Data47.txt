A Reunion with Macho
It felt so good within the soft straws that I ended up sleeping in for a longer period of time.
I woke up from the sound of the incoming hoofs.
I stuck my head outside the straws and turned to look at the direction where the sound comes from.
Morning light shined brightly from the within the entrance, a huge horse being pulled by a silhuette entered. The one pulling is a man. This guy is also big. Or rather, he’s huge.
When the man placed the horse in an empty cage, he saw me.

[Ah?]
Ah!

I know this person! He’s the Macho man who visited Yorugen’s shop! The man who Yorugen gave his acknowledgement!
I was completely delighted to meet a person a know. As I walked towards Macho, I energetically wagged my tail.

[You, aren’t you the dog from the shop last time?]
Macho placed his hands on my front feet and carried my as he said so.

Yea, that’s right It’s been a while.

I nodded as if I’m a chicken pecking at feeds.
Macho suddenly stopped.

[…Why are you in a place like this? Are you being kept here at the mansion?]

No, no.

I shook my head sideways swiftly.
Macho sttiffened up again.

You see, I have a reason so I need to enter the mansion. Can you do something about it?

That’s what I meant to say but the only sound that came out from my mouth was a pitiful *kyuuun* sound.
When I blinked my eyes at him, Macho placed me down.
I trottingly ran outside the stables. When I glanced back, I saw Macho following after me. When I got just a little bit of distance from the mansion, I turned my neck in its direction and made an appeal. I tapped the ground with my front leg.

I wish to enter that mansion.

Macho stopped and seemed to be thinking with his hand on his chin then murmured something.

[Do you need something in the mansion?]

Yes! That’s right!
I was so happy I got up and happily wagged my tail.
Macho sure is smart!
I walked over Macho’s boots and bit on the edge of his pants then tugged it.

Send me, inside, that mansion.

[Hey, don’t pull.]
Macho lifted me up with one hand and carried me in his bossom.

[So you want to get inside the mansion, huh. Got it.]
Macho unbuttoned the top of his vest and placed me inside.

Ooh, a close contact with Macho.
Macho’s body temperature is being transmitted through the thin fabric of his shirt. It somehow felt strange. But still, his stomach sure is rock hard. He must be pretty ripped. I playfully pushed on Macho’s muscles with my feet. As I thought, it’s hard. I’m so jealous! (TN: No homo! Not yet1! Stop being so naughty while in your dog form!!! Do it when you’re already human, darn it!)
[Hey, stop kicking me.]
I got scolded by Macho.

When Macho headed towards the entrance, the servant-like guy from yesterday was standing there.

[Hm? Alex-san, you’re pretty early.]
[Yo, Dirk. Sorry but I went and deposited my horse in the stables on my own. Can you please give it some water to drink later?]
[Of course, but]
[Let me meet with your master. I’ve made an appointment.]
[Haa, but, well, today is a bit…]

Ignoring the hesitating man, Macho went straight inside the mansion.
The old man from yesterday rushed in to meet us as if in a panick.
Macho stops.

[Alex-sama, please wait.]
The old man says.
[Hey, Fockel.]
[Good morning. Could you please wait here for a moment?]
[Don’t speak so foRmally. I need something from that guy. Sorry but I’ll have you let me through.]
Macho said so and climbed up the spiral staircase.

[You may not. I was ordered by master to not let anyone enter today no matter what.]
[I’m sorry. Please make this time an exception.]
[You may not proceed any further. Besides that, that creature inside your vest is?]
[It’s a dog. I decided to keep it starting today.]
[I would also like to detain that. Unfortunately, my master is not especially good with animals.]
[Is that so. I didn’t know.]
[Anyway, please wait.]
[Fockel, aren’t you also busy? You don’t need to attend to me.]
[Alex-sama!]

I see. So Macho’s name is Alex. I will also call him Alex from now on.

When Alex quickly arrived on the second floor while ignoring Fockel, quick footsteps could be heard towards the innermost room in the floor.
[Hey, Ferdinand, I’m coming in.]
After speaking, Alex opened the door without waiting for a reply.

Ferdinand’s Story
[Hey, get down.]
Alex’s stretched hand caught me. I got shoved inside his vest again. I was in a daze, so it’s an avoidable outcome.
When he saw my body lying on the bed, Alex whistled.

[Well, well,]

[Don’t touch that. Do you want to be killed?]

With Ferdinand’s words, Alex raised his hand.
[Hey, hey. Don’t be so scary.]
[Just by you looking at him makes me want to gauge your eyes out.] (TN: Uwa.. scary.)
[Wait wait wait. I’m not the only one who saw it, you know? A lot of people in town saw it yesterday.]
Upon hearing Alex’s words, Ferdinand’s hatred intensified.
[That coachman, unforgiveable. Even though I told him so much to conceal it.] (TN: That’s some bad service. They should close.)
[This, is it alive?]

Ferdinand breathed lightly then pointed at the chair in the corner with his chin.
[Sit.]
While Alex sat on the chair, Ferdinand went to the cabinet and took out 2 wineglasses and poured a red liquid to them. He handed the other one to Alex.
[Alcohol so early in the morning?]
[Just this much shouldn’t be such a big deal. To each other.]
To Ferdinand’s words, Alex grinned.

Ferdinand drained the contents in the glass and placed it on top of the table.
[I found it by chance at an antique shop called Bull’s Trap.]
[At an antique shop?]
[Yeah. Apparently, a hunter seemed to have found it within the forest and brought it out. He thought at first that it’s a corpse but when he touched it, it’s warm. It looked asleep but wasn’t waking up. It does not eat anything, does not drink, does not excrete, does not rot, it’s been in this state for many months. He took it as a living corpse and thought that if it’s an antique shop, they’ll accept it and forcefully left it there.]
[Haa, but that…are you sure that this is human?]
[Do you think he’s part of the demon kin?]
[Well..]

That isn’t a demon! That’s me! I’m human!
To be left in an antique shop, what the heck’s with that? Don’t sell someone else’s body without their permission, hey!

[I was taken by it at first glance.]

Eh.

Ferdinand sat at the edge of the bedside and touched my body’s cheek with his hand. (TN:I’m creeped out… I wonder why?)

Hii!! What are you doing?!

[I have never seen such a beautiful person before. When I touched his lips, the air trembled a little. I thought that such frailness looked irrisistible. My sould was grabbed by it. I thought my heart would come out from my throat. I ended up buying it at the asked price.] (TN: In other words, it’s love at first sight. Hmm.. )
[Oi, just how much was it…No, I suddenly got this feeling that I don’t want to hear it.]
[A wise decision.]
With a small laugh escaping from his throat, he traced his finger from my cheek to my throat.
[…No amount of money will be enough to buy him. With him just being here fills my heart with such warmth and happiness.]
Ferdinand suddenly turned to look at Alex.

[Do you remember our previous expidition?]
[There’s no way I can forget, can I? I would love to, though. It was the scariest experience I’ve ever had in my entire life that makes the hair at the back of my neck stand.]
[We lost a number of subordinates. As expected, even I was troubled by it.]
[That was not your fault. That plan was originally dangerous. Furthermore, the expidition itself was reckless.]
[…Some time after that, all the food I ate became tasteless. At the beginning, I was flooded with guilt but after some time, I wasn’t able to feel anything. Just like a dead man.]
Upon Ferdinand’s words, Alex looked at him with idyllic gaze.

[Yet, the moment I found him,]
Ferdinand’s fingers comb my hair.
[Just like a storm, he woke my heart up. I’ve learned for the first time what affection means. To the point that it hurts. I don’t mind even if he’s a demon. He can be anything. I can no longer let go of him.]
[Ferdinand..]
Alex breathed heavily.
[You are aware that you’re being crazy, right?]
[Of course.]
Ferdinand laughed from the back of his throat.
[I’m aware of it.]
[Then, I won’t say anything. I saw nothing in here and there’s nothing brought in. Is this fine?]
[…Yeah. I’m glad I told you.]
Ferdinand rose and patted Alex’s shoulder.
A small smile appeared from the two’s lips.
[I’m leaving. I’ve disturbed you.]

Wa, WAIT A MOMENT—!!!

I trembled with too much anger.
What the heck’s with this “case solved”-like atmosphere?!

Nothing’s been resolved, yet, has it?!
What’s gonna happen to my body? Is it still alive? Is it dead? Can I return to that body? Or will I always stay as a dog? I still don’t understand a thing!

Besides, other than that, if we leave my body here, something will definitely be done to it, right?
Like that thing, or like this thing. This isn’t just something from my imagination, right? I’m in a terrible pinch, aren’t I?

Nooo—!!!

I once again jumped down from ALex’s vest, hopped on top of my body and covered my own face.

This is my own body, ok? Don’t just touch whenever you want–!

Was what I planned on shouting, but what came out of my mouth were low growls.

[Hey, you idiot! What are you doing?! Do you want to be killed?!]
Alex panicked and got me off.
In the corner of my eyes, I can see cold blue eyes glaring at me with heavy bloodlust.
[Th, then, I’m leaving! Later!]
Alex held me under his armpit and ran out of the room as if his life depends on it.
(TN: What about his body?! Oi!)
