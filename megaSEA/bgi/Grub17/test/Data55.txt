The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn't 
exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind 
the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything. 

But he stayed with the job because the merchant, although he was an old grouch, treated him fairly; the 
boy received a good commission for each piece he sold, and had already been able to put some money 
aside. That morning he had done some calculating: if he continued to work every day as he had been, he 
would need a whole year to be able to buy some sheep. 

"I'd like to build a display case for the crystal," the boy said to the merchant. "We could place it outside, 
and attract those people who pass at the bottom of the hill." 

"I've never had one before," the merchant answered. "People will pass by and bump into it, and pieces 
will be broken." 

"Well, when I took my sheep through the fields some of them might have died if we had come upon a 
snake. But that's the way life is with sheep and with shepherds." 

The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses. He was selling better than ever. . . 
as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier's major attractions. 

"Business has really improved," he said to the boy, after the customer had left. "I'm doing much better, 
and soon you'll be able to return to your sheep. Why ask more out of life?" 

"Because we have to respond to omens," the boy said, almost without meaning to; then he regretted 
what he had said, because the merchant had never met the king. 

"It's called the principle of favorability, beginner's luck. Because life wants you to achieve your destiny," 
the old king had said. 

But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy's very presence in the shop was an omen, 
and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired 
the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that 
sales wouldn't amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would 
soon return to his sheep. 

"Why did you want to get to the Pyramids?" he asked, to get away from the business of the display. 

"Because I've always heard about them," the boy answered, saying nothing about his dream. The 
treasure was now nothing but a painful memory, and he tried to avoid thinking about it. 

"I don't know anyone around here who would want to cross the desert just to see the Pyramids," said 
the merchant. "They're just a pile of stones. You could build one in your backyard." 

"You've never had dreams of travel," said the boy, turning to wait on a customer who had entered the 
shop. 

Two days later, the merchant spoke to the boy about the display. 



"I don't much like change," he said. "You and I aren't like Hassan, that rich merchant. If he makes a 
buying mistake, it doesn't affect him much. But we two have to live with our mistakes." 

That's true enough, the boy thought, ruefully. 

"Why did you think we should have the display?" 

"I want to get back to my sheep faster. We have to take advantage when luck is on our side, and do as 
much to help it as it's doing to help us. It's called the principle of favorability. Or beginner's luck." 

The merchant was silent for a few moments. Then he said, "The Prophet gave us the Koran, and left us 
just five obligations to satisfy during our lives. The most important is to believe only in the one true God. 
The others are to pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and be charitable to the poor." 

He stopped there. His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the Prophet. He was a devout man, and, 
even with all his impatience, he wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law. 

"What's the fifth obligation?" the boy asked. 

"Two days ago, you said that I had never dreamed of travel," the merchant answered. "The fifth 
obligation of every Muslim is a pilgrimage. We are obliged, at least once in our lives, to visit the holy city 
of Mecca. 

"Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together 
enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday I'd be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to 
make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals 
are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. 
Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people 
making the pilgrimage were poorer than I. 

"All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the 
doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had 
traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the 
streets of Tangier buying his leather." 

"Well, why don't you go to Mecca now?" asked the boy. 

"Because it's the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That's what helps me face these days that are all 
the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible cafe. I'm afraid 
that if my dream is realized, I'll have no reason to go on living. 

"You dream about your sheep and the Pyramids, but you're different from me, because you want to 
realize your dreams. I just want to dream about Mecca. I've already imagined a thousand times crossing 
the desert, arriving at the Plaza of the Sacred Stone, the seven times I walk around it before allowing 
myself to touch it. I've already imagined the people who would be at my side, and those in front of me, 
and the conversations and prayers we would share. But I'm afraid that it would all be a disappointment, 
so I prefer just to dream about it." 

That day, the merchant gave the boy permission to build the display. Not everyone can see his dreams 
come true in the same way. 



Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop. The boy 
estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet 
another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business 
with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the 
marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as 
distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant. Anyway, the boy had become happy in his 
work, and thought all the time about the day when he would disembark at Tarifa as a winner. 

"You must always know what it is that you want," the old king had said. The boy knew, and was now 
working toward it. Maybe it was his treasure to have wound up in that strange land, met up with a thief, 
and doubled the size of his flock without spending a cent. 

He was proud of himself. He had learned some important things, like how to deal in crystal, and about 
the language without words. . . and about omens. One afternoon he had seen a man at the top of the hill, 
complaining that it was impossible to find a decent place to get something to drink after such a climb. The 
boy, accustomed to recognizing omens, spoke to the merchant. 

"Let's sell tea to the people who climb the hill." 

"Lots of places sell tea around here," the merchant said. 

"But we could sell tea in crystal glasses. The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses. I 
have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men." 

The merchant didn't respond, but that afternoon, after saying his prayers and closing the shop, he invited 
the boy to sit with him and share his hookah, that strange pipe used by the Arabs. 

"What is it you're looking for?" asked the old merchant. 

"I've already told you. I need to buy my sheep back, so I have to earn the money to do so." 

The merchant put some new coals in the hookah, and inhaled deeply. 

"I've had this shop for thirty years. I know good crystal from bad, and everything else there is to know 
about crystal. I know its dimensions and how it behaves. If we serve tea in crystal, the shop is going to 
expand. And then I'll have to change my way of life." 

"Well, isn't that good?" 

"I'm already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had 
wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than 
they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasn't been too bad. The shop is 
exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I don't want to change anything, because I don't know how to 
deal with change. I'm used to the way I am." 

The boy didn't know what to say. The old man continued, "You have been a real blessing to me. Today, 
I understand something I didn't see before: every blessing ignored becomes a curse. I don't want anything 
else in life. But you are forcing me to look at wealth and at horizons I have never known. Now that I 
have seen them, and now that I see how immense my possibilities are, I'm going to feel worse than I did 



before you arrived. Because I know the things I should be able to accomplish, and I don't want to do 
so." 

It's good I refrained from saying anything to the baker in Tarifa, thought the boy to himself. 

They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set. They were conversing in Arabic, and 
the boy was proud of himself for being able to do so. There had been a time when he thought that his 
sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world. But they could never have taught 
him Arabic. 

There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can't teach me, thought the boy as he 
regarded the old merchant. All they ever do, really, is look for food and water. And maybe it wasn't that 
they were teaching me, but that I was learning from them. 

"Maktub," the merchant said, finally. 

"What does that mean?" 

"You would have to have been bom an Arab to understand," he answered. "But in your language it 
would be something like It is written.' " 

And, as he smothered the coals in the hookah, he told the boy that he could begin to sell tea in the 
crystal glasses. Sometimes, there's just no way to hold back the river. 



The men climbed the hill, and they were tired when they reached the top. But there they saw a crystal 
shop that offered refreshing mint tea. They went in to drink the tea, which was served in beautiful crystal 
glasses. 

"My wife never thought of this," said one, and he bought some crystal — he was entertaining guests that 
night, and the guests would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware. The other man remarked that 
tea was always more delicious when it was served in crystal, because the aroma was retained. The third 
said that it was a tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers. 

Before long, the news spread, and a great many people began to climb the hill to see the shop that was 
doing something new in a trade that was so old. Other shops were opened that served tea in crystal, but 
they weren't at the top of a hill, and they had little business. 

Eventually, the merchant had to hire two more employees. He began to import enormous quantities of 
tea, along with his crystal, and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new. 

And, in that way, the months passed. 



The boy awoke before dawn. It had been eleven months and nine days since he had first set foot on the 
African continent. 

He dressed in his Arabian clothing of white linen, bought especially for this day. He put his headcloth in 
place and secured it with a ring made of camel skin. Wearing his new sandals, he descended the stairs 



silently.
