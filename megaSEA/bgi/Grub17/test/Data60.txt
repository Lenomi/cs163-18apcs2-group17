The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima. He told her about his life as a shepherd, about 
the king, and about the crystal shop. They became friends, and except for the fifteen minutes he spent 



with her, each day seemed that it would never pass. When he had been at the oasis for almost a month, 
the leader of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him. 

"We don't know when the war will end, so we can't continue our journey," he said. "The battles may last 
for a long time, perhaps even years. There are powerful forces on both sides, and the war is important to 
both armies. It's not a battle of good against evil. It's a war between forces that are fighting for the 
balance of power, and, when that type of battle begins, it lasts longer than others — because Allah is on 
both sides." 

The people went back to where they were living, and the boy went to meet with Fatima that afternoon. 
He told her about the morning's meeting. "The day after we met," Fatima said, "you told me that you 
loved me. Then, you taught me something of the universal language and the Soul of the World. Because 
of that, I have become a part of you." 

The boy listened to the sound of her voice, and thought it to be more beautiful than the sound of the wind 
in the date palms. 

"I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time. I have forgotten about my past, about my 
traditions, and the way in which men of the desert expect women to behave. Ever since I was a child, I 
have dreamed that the desert would bring me a wonderful present. Now, my present has arrived, and it's 
you." 

The boy wanted to take her hand. But Fatima's hands held to the handles of her jug. 

"You have told me about your dreams, about the old king and your treasure. And you've told me about 
omens. So now, I fear nothing, because it was those omens that brought you to me. And I am a part of 
your dream, a part of your destiny, as you call it. 

"That's why I want you to continue toward your goal. If you have to wait until the war is over, then wait. 
But if you have to go before then, go on in pursuit of your dream. The dunes are changed by the wind, 
but the desert never changes. That's the way it will be with our love for each other. 

"Maktub ," she said. "If I am really a part of your dream, you'll come back one day." 

The boy was sad as he left her that day. He thought of all the married shepherds he had known. They 
had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields. Love required them to 
stay with the people they loved. 

He told Fatima that, at their next meeting. 

"The desert takes our men from us, and they don't always return," she said. "We know that, and we are 
used to it. Those who don't return become a part of the clouds, a part of the animals that hide in the 
ravines and of the water that comes from the earth. They become a part of everything . . . they become the 
Soul of the World. 

"Some do come back. And then the other women are happy because they believe that their men may 
one day return, as well. I used to look at those women and envy them their happiness. Now, I too will be 
one of the women who wait. 

"I'm a desert woman, and I'm proud of that. I want my husband to wander as free as the wind that 
shapes the dunes. And, if I have to, I will accept the fact that he has become a part of the clouds, and the 



animals and the water of the desert." 

The boy went to look for the Englishman. He wanted to tell him about Fatima. He was surprised when 
he saw that the Englishman had built himself a furnace outside his tent. It was a strange furnace, fueled by 
firewood, with a transparent flask heating on top. As the Englishman stared out at the desert, his eyes 
seemed brighter than they had when he was reading his books. 

"This is the first phase of the job," he said. "I have to separate out the sulfur. To do that successfully, I 
must have no fear of failure. It was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master Work. 
Now, I'm beginning what I could have started ten years ago. But I'm happy at least that I didn't wait 
twenty years." 

He continued to feed the fire, and the boy stayed on until the desert turned pink in the setting sun. He felt 
the urge to go out into the desert, to see if its silence held the answers to his questions. 

He wandered for a while, keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight. He listened to the wind, and 
felt the stones beneath his feet. Here and there, he found a shell, and realized that the desert, in remote 
times, had been a sea. He sat on a stone, and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon. He 
tried to deal with the concept of love as distinct from possession, and couldn't separate them. But Fatima 
was a woman of the desert, and, if anything could help him to understand, it was the desert. 

As he sat there thinking, he sensed movement above him. Looking up, he saw a pair of hawks flying high 
in the sky. 

He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind. Although their flight appeared to have no pattern, it 
made a certain kind of sense to the boy. It was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant. He followed the 
movement of the birds, trying to read something into it. Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the 
meaning of love without ownership. 

He felt sleepy. In his heart, he wanted to remain awake, but he also wanted to sleep. "I am learning the 
Language of the World, and everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me. . . even the flight of 
the hawks," he said to himself. And, in that mood, he was grateful to be in love. When you are in love, 
things make even more sense, he thought. 

Suddenly, one of the hawks made a flashing dive through the sky, attacking the other. As it did so, a 
sudden, fleeting image came to the boy: an army, with its swords at the ready, riding into the oasis. The 
vision vanished immediately, but it had shaken him. He had heard people speak of mirages, and had 
already seen some himself: they were desires that, because of their intensity, materialized over the sands 
of the desert. But he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis. 

He wanted to forget about the vision, and return to his meditation. He tried again to concentrate on the 
pink shades of the desert, and its stones. But there was something there in his heart that wouldn't allow 
him to do so. 

"Always heed the omens," the old king had said. The boy recalled what he had seen in the vision, and 
sensed that it was actually going to occur. 

He rose, and made his way back toward the palm trees. Once again, he perceived the many languages 
in the things about him: this time, the desert was safe, and it was the oasis that had become dangerous. 

The camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree, observing the sunset. He saw the boy appear 



from the other side of the dunes. 

"An army is coming," the boy said. "I had a vision." 

"The desert fills men's hearts with visions," the camel driver answered. 

But the boy told him about the hawks: that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself 
to have plunged to the Soul of the World. 

The camel driver understood what the boy was saying. He knew that any given thing on the face of the 
earth could reveal the history of all things. One could open a book to any page, or look at a person's 
hand; one could turn a card, or watch the flight of the birds. . . whatever the thing observed, one could 
find a connection with his experience of the moment. Actually, it wasn't that those things, in themselves, 
revealed anything at all; it was just that people, looking at what was occurring around them, could find a 
means of penetration to the Soul of the World. 

The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to 
the Soul of the World. They were known as seers, and they were held in fear by women and the elderly. 
Tribesmen were also wary of consulting them, because it would be impossible to be effective in battle if 
one knew that he was fated to die. The tribesmen preferred the taste of battle, and the thrill of not 
knowing what the outcome would be; the future was already written by Allah, and what he had written 
was always for the good of man. So the tribesmen lived only for the present, because the present was full 
of surprises, and they had to be aware of many things: Where was the enemy's sword? Where was his 
horse? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The camel driver was not a 
fighter, and he had consulted with seers. Many of them had been right about what they said, while some 
had been wrong. Then, one day, the oldest seer he had ever sought out (and the one most to be feared) 
had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future. 

"Well. . . so I can do things," he had responded. "And so I can change those things that I don't want to 
happen." 

"But then they wouldn't be a part of your future," the seer had said. 

"Well, maybe I just want to know the future so I can prepare myself for what's coming." 

"If good things are coming, they will be a pleasant surprise," said the seer. "If bad things are, and you 
know in advance, you will suffer greatly before they even occur." 

"I want to know about the future because I'm a man," the camel driver had said to the seer. "And men 
always live their lives based on the future." 

The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs; he threw them on the ground, and made interpretations 
based on how they fell. That day, he didn't make a cast. He wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put 
them back in his bag. 

"I make my living forecasting the future for people," he said. "I know the science of the twigs, and I 
know how to use them to penetrate to the place where all is written. There, I can read the past, discover 
what has already been forgotten, and understand the omens that are here in the present. 

"When people consult me, it's not that I'm reading the future; I am guessing at the future. The future 
belongs to God, and it is only he who reveals it, under extraordinary circumstances. How do I guess at 



the future? Based on the omens of the present. The secret is here in the present. If you pay attention to 
the present, you can improve upon it. And, if you improve on the present, what comes later will also be 
better. Forget about the future, and live each day according to the teachings, confident that God loves his 
children. Each day, in itself, brings with it an eternity." 

The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the 
future. 

"Only when he, himself, reveals it. And God only rarely reveals the future. When he does so, it is for only 
one reason: it's a future that was written so as to be altered." 

God had shown the boy a part of the future, the camel driver thought. Why was it that he wanted the 
boy to serve as his instrument? 

"Go and speak to the tribal chieftains," said the camel driver. "Tell them about the armies that are 
approaching." 



"They'll laugh at me."
